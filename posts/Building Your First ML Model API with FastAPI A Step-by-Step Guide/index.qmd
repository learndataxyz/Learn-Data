If you have built AI applications, you might have used an API from OpenAI or Anthrophonic. These are models that are made easily accessible to developers through APIs. Have you ever wondered how these APIs were built? This article will teach you how to build your first machine learning model API using FastAPI.

FastAPI is a Python library for building APIs, especially REST APIs. As a data scientist or machine learning engineer, you can make your machine learning model available to clients through an API. This API will fetch client input and return predictions, making it easy for anyone to use your model in their application.

## Prerequisites

-   Python 3.9+ installed
-   IDE or code editor such as VS Code
-   The following libraries are are installed:
    -   `fastapi` to build the ML model API
    -   `pandas` for data wrangling
    -   `seaborn` for the sample dataset
    -   `scikit-learn` for building the predictive model
    -   `joblib` for exporting the model as a joblib file
    -   `uvicorn` a lightweight server for running the ML API
    -   `pydantic` for type annotations

## Step 1 - Setup Working Directory

Create a project and give it an appropriate name. Inside the project directory, create the following files: `app.py` for the API code and [`utilis.py`](http://utilis.py) for the code to build the predictive model. Next, create and activate a virtual environment.

``` python
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Next, install the following libraries.

``` python
pip install fastapi pandas seaborn scikit-learn joblib uvicorn pydantic
```

## Step 2 - Preprare the Dataset

For this article, you will build a machine learning model using the `tips` dataset in the `seaborn` library. Here are the variables in the `tips` dataset.

-   `total_bill`: The total amount of the bill.
-   `tip`: The tip amount given.
-   `sex`: The gender of the payer.
-   `smoker`: Whether or not the payer smoked.
-   `day`: The day of the week.
-   `time`: The time of day.
-   `size`: The size of the dining party.

The `tips` dataset has six features, and you will build a model predicting the `tip` amount given. Import the following libraries into the `utilis.py` file.

``` python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
import joblib
```

Create a function `prepare_dataset` inside [`utilis.py`](http://utilis.py) that splits the tips dataset into training and testing datasets and returns them.

``` python
def prepare_dataset():
    """Load and prepare the dataset for modeling"""
    # Load the tips dataset from seaborn
    tips = sns.load_dataset('tips')
    
    print("Dataset overview:")
    print(tips.head())
    print("\nDataset info:")
    print(tips.info())
    
    # Convert categorical features to dummy variables
    tips_encoded = pd.get_dummies(tips, columns=['sex', 'smoker', 'day', 'time'])
    
    # Define features and target
    X = tips_encoded.drop('tip', axis=1)
    y = tips_encoded['tip']
    
    # Split the data
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    
    return X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, X.columns
```

As you may have noticed, we have one-hot encoded some of our features: `sex`, `smoker`, `day`, and `time`. This means that each value in these features is a variable, and the clients will send Boolean values to these new variables.

## Step 3 - Build the Machine Learning Model

Create the function `train_model` inside [`utilis.py`](http://utilis.py) that builds a random forest regressor by taking the training features and outcome variable.

``` python
def train_model(X_train, y_train):
    """Train a RandomForestRegressor model"""
    # Create a pipeline with preprocessing and model
    pipeline = Pipeline([
        ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
        ('regressor', RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42))
    ])
    
    # Train the model
    pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    return pipeline
```

Create another function, `evaluate_model`, that returns the random forest model's evaluation metrics, `mse`, and `r2`. This function takes the model, test features, and outcome as arguments.

``` python
def evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test):
    """Evaluate the trained model"""
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    
    # Calculate metrics
    mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
    r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
    
    print(f"Model Evaluation:")
    print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse:.4f}")
    print(f"R² Score: {r2:.4f}")
    
    return mse, r2
```

Next, create the function that saves the model into your project directory. This is important if your model takes time to build. Instead of constantly re-running the model, you have all the model weights saved to a file. The `joblib` file stores all the model weights and makes it easy to make predictions for a new dataset.

``` python
def save_model(model, filename="tip_predictor_model.joblib"):
    """Save the trained model to a file"""
    joblib.dump(model, filename)
    print(f"Model saved as {filename}")
```

Finally, create the function `prepare_and_train_model()`. This function calls all the functions we created earlier and returns the `model` and `feature_names`. We also save the `feature_names` to a `joblib` file to validate incoming inputs from clients in the API.

``` python
def prepare_and_train_model():
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test, feature_names = prepare_dataset()
    model = train_model(X_train, y_train)
    evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test)
    save_model(model)
    
    # Save feature names for input validation
    joblib.dump(feature_names, "feature_names.joblib")
    
    return model, feature_names
```

## Step 4 - Create the API Endpoints

Go to [`app.py`](http://app.py) and paste the following imports.

``` python
import pandas as pd

from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

import joblib
from utilis import prepare_and_train_model
```

The code above also imports the `prepare_and_train_model` from the `utilis.py` file. Next, create an instance of the FastAPI class.

``` python
app = FastAPI(
    title="Restaurant Tip Predictor API",
    description="API for predicting tips using the Seaborn tips dataset",
    version="1.0.0"
)
```

The `FastAPI` class provides the `title`, `description`, and `version` of the ML Model API. To validate client input, define a Pydantic model `TipsPredictionRequest`.

``` python
class TipPredictionRequest(BaseModel):
    total_bill: float = Field(..., description="Total bill amount", gt=0)
    size: int = Field(..., description="Party size", gt=0)
    sex_Female: bool = Field(False, description="Customer is female")
    sex_Male: bool = Field(False, description="Customer is male")
    smoker_No: bool = Field(False, description="Non-smoker")
    smoker_Yes: bool = Field(False, description="Smoker")
    day_Fri: bool = Field(False, description="Friday")
    day_Sat: bool = Field(False, description="Saturday")
    day_Sun: bool = Field(False, description="Sunday")
    day_Thur: bool = Field(False, description="Thursday")
    time_Dinner: bool = Field(False, description="Dinner time")
    time_Lunch: bool = Field(False, description="Lunch time")
```

The code above specifies several fields with types and validation rules, including `total_bill` (a required buoyant float representing the total bill amount) and `size` (a required positive integer representing the size of the dining party).

The model also includes a series of boolean fields, all of which default to `False`, that encode categorical features such as the customer's sex (`sex_Female`, `sex_Male`), smoking status (`smoker_No`, `smoker_Yes`), day of the week (`day_Fri`, `day_Sat`, `day_Sun`, `day_Thur`), and meal time (`time_Dinner`, `time_Lunch`).

Create a Pydantic model `TipPredictionResponse` for the API response, also.

``` python
class TipPredictionResponse(BaseModel):
    predicted_tip: float
```

Create a function that loads the ML model `joblib` file.

``` python
def load_model(model_path="tip_predictor_model.joblib"):
    """Load the trained model from file"""
    try:
        model = joblib.load(model_path)
        return model
    except:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=500, 
            detail="Model not found. Please train the model first."
        )
```

The `load_model` function loads the `joblib` file from the specified path. If an error occurs, an HTTPException is raised.

Paste the following code also into the [`utilis.py`](http://utilis.py) file.

``` python

model = None
feature_names = None

@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup_event():
    """Load model on startup"""
    global model, feature_names
    try:
        model = joblib.load("tip_predictor_model.joblib")
        feature_names = joblib.load("feature_names.joblib")
        print("Model loaded successfully")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error loading model: {e}")
        print("Training new model...")
        model, feature_names = prepare_and_train_model()
```

The code above defines an asynchronous function, `startup_event()`, that runs when the application starts, using the `@app.on_event("startup")` decorator.

The function aims to load the machine learning model `tip_predictor_model.joblib` and its associated feature names `feature_names.joblib` from disk into global variables `model` and `feature_names`.

If loading the model files fails, the function catches the exception, logs an error message, and calls `prepare_and_train_model()` to train a new model and set the global variables accordingly. This ensures the app always has a ready-to-use model, either loaded or freshly trained, upon startup.

Copy and paste the following code also.

``` python
@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    """Root endpoint"""
    return {"message": "Welcome to the Restaurant Tip Predictor API"}
```

The code above defines a simple HTTP GET endpoint at the application's root URL (`"/"`), using the `@app.get("/")` decorator.

The function `read_root()` is called whenever someone accesses the root path. It returns a JSON response containing a message: `{"message": "Welcome to the Restaurant Tip Predictor API"}`.

This serves as a basic welcome or health check endpoint to confirm that the API is running and reachable. Next, create the model endpoint as follows.

``` python
@app.post("/predict", response_model=TipPredictionResponse)
def predict_tip(request: TipPredictionRequest):
    """Predict tip amount based on input features"""
    # Convert input data to DataFrame with correct columns
    input_dict = request.model_dump()
    input_df = pd.DataFrame([input_dict])
    
    # Reorder columns to match the model's expected feature names
    try:
        input_df = input_df[feature_names]
    except KeyError as e:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=400,
            detail=f"Input data is missing required features: {e}"
        )
    
    # Make prediction
    predicted_tip = model.predict(input_df)[0]
    
    return TipPredictionResponse(
        predicted_tip=round(float(predicted_tip), 2)
    )
```

This code defines a POST endpoint at `"/predict"` in the application, using the `@app.post` decorator with a specified `response_model` of `TipPredictionResponse`.

The `predict_tip` function accepts a request payload of type `TipPredictionRequest`, which contains the input features needed for the prediction. It converts the request data into a dictionary and then a Pandas DataFrame.

The columns of the DataFrame are reordered to match the expected order defined by the global `feature_names`. If any required feature is missing, it raises a `400 Bad Request` error using an `HTTPException`.

Once the input is validated and properly formatted, the function uses the pre-loaded machine learning `model` to predict the tip amount, rounds the prediction to two decimal places, and returns it as a `TipPredictionResponse` object.

To be able to run the model API, copy and paste the following code at the end of your [`app.py`](http://app.py) file.

``` python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        model = joblib.load("tip_predictor_model.joblib")
        feature_names = joblib.load("feature_names.joblib")
    except:
        print("No model found. Training new model...")
        model, feature_names = prepare_and_train_model()
        
    # Run the API server
    uvicorn.run("app:app", host="0.0.0.0", port=8000, reload=True)
```

The code above is the application's entry point. It runs only when the script is executed directly, not when imported as a module.

It first tries to load a pre-trained model and its feature names using `joblib`. If the files are not found or loading fails, they don’t exist; it catches the exception and trains a new model by calling `prepare_and_train_model()`.

After that, it starts a FastAPI server using `uvicorn`, binding it to all network interfaces `0.0.0.0` on port `8000` with auto-reload enabled. This is helpful for development as it restarts the server when code changes.

## Step 5 - Test the API endpoints

To test the API, call the following shell command on your terminal.

``` python
python -m app
```

Your application will automatically open up at the URL `https://0.0.0.0:8000`

![API application root url. Image by Author](image.png){fig-alt="image showing the machine learning application opening at the root URL."}

To view the automatically generated interactive API documentation, add `/docs` to the end of the API URL `https://0.0.0.0:8000/docs` .

![API application documentation page. Image by Author.](image%201.png){fig-alt="image showing the API application documentation page"}

You will notice that we have two API endpoints. The first one is the root URL that opens when the API launches, while the second is the prediction endpoint.

Click on the dropdown of the prediction endpoint, and give the various appropriate values in the JSON fields.
