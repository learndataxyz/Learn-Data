In an era where there is a huge and vast amount of data, the need for professionals who can manage and make sense of this data is needed, either by describing, modelling or identifying patterns in data. 

As someone who has worked as a freelance Data Scientist for over 5 years in the data industry, I aim to train and educate you on how you can become one of the best data professionals out there either as a Data Analyst, Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer.

I graduated with a BSc in Statistics and currently working as a Biostatistician at a public hospital assisting medical researchers in analysing health data. As a technical writer, I have written various articles and have thousands of reads on medium.

I am proficient in Mathematics, Statistics and Programming (R and Python) and have a strong domain knowledge of the health sector. 

As a data scientist, my day-to-day activities range from performing exploratory data analysis to building machine learning or deep learning models. 

My biggest happiness comes when students benefit from my courses and I hope as you are reading this, you have either enrolled or are about to enroll in one of my courses. 

I wish you all the best in your path to becoming a world-class data professional!
