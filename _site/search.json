    "text": "In an era where “ML” and “AI” are the latest industry buzzwords, one essential skill often overlooked by aspiring machine learning engineers is web development.\nEarly in my ML journey, I was obsessed with leaderboard performance; fine-tuning models on Kaggle and Zindi to gain a 0.0001% boost in accuracy. But I soon realized that outside competitions, performance metrics don’t matter unless your model is accessible and usable by real people. Most users don’t care about ROC curves or F1 scores; they care about how the model helps them solve a problem.\nThis realization led me to web development. If users are to interact with your ML solution, you must expose it through intuitive interfaces, APIs, or real-time applications. This article explains why foundational web development skills are increasingly crucial for ML and AI practitioners."

    "text": "The Modern ML Landscape\n\nThe Role of an ML Engineer\nA machine learning engineer’s typical responsibilities include collecting data, training models, evaluating performance, and fine-tuning hyperparameters. However, this is only part of the pipeline.\nAfter training a model, the next challenge is model deployment, also known as inference, which involves bringing the model into production. This includes creating APIs, deploying models to servers, and integrating them into products that users interact with.\nUnfortunately, many ML engineers focus solely on algorithm performance and neglect this final, critical step: serving the model to end users. This is where web development skills come into play.\n\n\nThe Shift Toward Full-Stack ML\nIn the past, ML engineers handed off their models to software engineers for deployment. Today, ML engineers are expected to build end-to-end solutions, from data ingestion to user interaction, especially in startups and lean teams.\nThis shift has driven the growth of MLOps (Machine Learning Operations), which brings automation, scalability, and monitoring to the ML lifecycle. Basic web development knowledge makes implementing MLOps workflows and building more robust systems easier.\nA model only has real-world value if people can use it. Making it accessible, interactive, and reliable is crucial, and these goals overlap heavily with traditional web development."

Contrary to popular belief, this doesn’t require mastering HTML, CSS, or JavaScript from scratch.\n\nPython-friendly frameworks like Streamlit, Dash, and Shiny allow you to build dashboards or web apps with minimal code.\nIf you’re comfortable learning JavaScript, frameworks like React or Vue offer more flexibility and scalability for production-grade frontends.\n\nThe goal isn’t to become a designer—it’s to make your model accessible and usable.\n\n\nBackend Development and APIs\nServing your model to other applications or users usually involves creating an API.\n\nFlask and FastAPI are two lightweight Python frameworks widely used for building REST APIs.\nWith FastAPI, you can efficiently serve your ML model, handle incoming data, and return predictions—ideal for real-time applications.\n\nYou may also need to persist user inputs or logs. In such cases:\n\nUse ORMs like SQLAlchemy or SQLModel for SQL databases.\nConsider NoSQL databases like MongoDB or Firebase for flexible schema needs.\n\n\n\nDeployment and Infrastructure\nOnce your model is wrapped in an API and connected to a frontend, it must be deployed.\n\nDocker is a great way to containerize your app and ensure consistent deployment across different environments.\nHosting options include Heroku, Render, AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure—many offer free tiers for small projects.\n\nSetting up CI/CD pipelines ensures automated testing, deployment, and retraining workflows for production-grade projects. GitHub Actions is a great starting point."

    "text": "What Is Missing Data?\nMissing data are observations in our data that are missing either due to systematic issues, such as data collection errors, equipment malfunction, or survey design flaws, or due to random factors like non-response, recording mistakes, or accidental data loss.\nMissing datasets are of different types:\n\nMissing Completely at Random (MCAR): Missing observations are unrelated to the data. For example, a researcher accidentally loses some survey responses because of a computer glitch. In this case, the missing responses have nothing to do with the participants or their answers.\nMissing at Random (MAR): Missing observations are related to the observed data, but not to the missing data itself. For example, in a health survey, younger people are less likely to report their income. Here, missing income depends on age, which is already recorded, but not on the income value itself.\nMissing Not at Random (MNAR): In this case, missing observations are related to the data itself, even after accounting for the observed data. For example, People with higher incomes are less likely to report their income; the missing data depends on unobserved values.\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Missing Data. Image by Author."

    "text": "The Hidden Costs\nMissing data is not something that you should take trivial when training your data; there are a lot of hidden consequences that one can encounter if one does not handle them properly.\n\nModel performance degradation\nIf some classes or groups have more missing values than others, your training data becomes skewed toward the classes that are more complete.\nFor example, in a medical dataset, older patients may have more missing lab test results, and if those patients are more likely to have a disease, your model ends up learning from healthier (younger) samples more often. This results in a skewed training, making the model underrepresent older or diseased individuals.\n\n\nBias amplification\nMissing data rarely appear at random; most times they come from an underrepresented group. For example, minority populations may have less access to medical services, so their health outcomes are underrecorded.\nOr, data collected via smartphones or online platforms often underrepresents groups with limited internet access. So, you can see that the data is not missing at random, but it’s instead tied to inequality in who gets seen or counted.\nThis makes the issue of missing data sensitive and can lead to bias in a machine learning model, reducing model accuracy.\nIf missing data has groups that are underrepresented, it would not have sufficient data to learn from that group, and become less confident and less accurate when making predictions about them.\nA simple example is a facial recognition model trained mostly on images of light-skinned people; this model will perform worse on dark-skinned individuals, not because of bad algorithms, but because of missing or imbalanced data.\n\n\nOperational & Financial Costs\nA lot of time and money is usually spent trying to clean and impute missing data, especially when the proportion of missing data is high. Not doing all these before training your data can incur operational loss.\nA trained model on missing data can offer wrong classification or prediction to users, which can lead to regulatory risks and also breach of trust in the organization’s services.\nIf the data was not imputed well, this can distort importance scores or SHAP values, making it harder to trust model insights.\n\n\n\nCosts of missing data.

    "text": "Mitigation Strategies\nThere are various ways to avoid the costs that come with missing data when training an ML model. Here are some:\n\nPrevention: Avoiding errors during data collection ensures that your data is as clean as possible. If the data is coming through pipelines, ensure that the pipeline components are working properly to avoid components breaking and resulting in missing values in the final dataset. Ensure you also have validation checks to ensure that the right data is always passed; for example, numeric fields should not accept characters, and so on.\nImputation: In the presence of missing data, it’s always encouraged to use advanced imputation techniques where applicable instead of mean, median, or mode imputation. These techniques take into account the relationship of variables in the dataset, ensuring that at least the closest possible values are imputed.\nMonitoring: After deploying your machine learning model, ensure you always have post-deployment checks to check your model’s performance. Model drifts can happen, which can occur as a result of bad or missing data from new updates."

It causes a lot of harm than good, especially for the model and the users of the model.\nBad imputation practices, discarding them when there are many, are reasons that can make you have a bad model fit.\nYou must treat missing data imputation as the first step in your ML lifecycle, and spend enough time imputing it.\nBefore imputation, you should find out the relationship between the missing values and the data to know how best to handle them. This ensures you don’t impute a missing value when it’s actually supposed to be missing.\nEven though algorithms can now handle data with missing values, too much of disappeared values might prevent the model not to learn some information, which can bias predictions when predicting on the test set.\nIn summary, treat data completeness as a first-class citizen in your ML lifecycle.\n\nNeed Help with Data?

Shiny applications are based on reactive programming, which means that both the input and outputs are connected, and the output automatically updates when the input is changed.\nThe way Shiny operates, outputs can change without a user’s action, and a small change can affect other outputs randomly.\nDue to Shiny reactive programming, Shiny stores states between interactions in reactive values, reactive expressions, and observers. Side effects, such as database queries, dynamic interaction, and file uploads, can introduce complexity.\nAlthough it’s commonly believed that UI can’t be tested due to its interactive nature, you must test your Shiny apps, bearing in mind their reactive nature and how dynamic their state is."

You must make your code modular by separating various components into functions and modules to make them testable.\nYou can also move functions out of reactivity.

    "text": "UI Testing: How Far Should You Go?\nMost of the time, there are various arguments on whether you should go for browser-based testing or logic-level testing.\nThere are several factors to consider, and the following table provides a tradeoff analysis of both methods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApproach\nPros\nCons\n\n\n\n\nLogic-level testing(reactive functions, outputs)\nFast, deterministic, easy to debug, and encourages modular design\nDoesn’t catch integration bugs, No UI assurance\n\n\nBrowser-based testing(full end-to-end)\nCaptures real-world behavior, Tests JavaScript/UI bugs\nSlower, flakier, and harder to debug, Higher maintenance\n\n\n\nSome tools you should consider while building browser tests are:\n\nPlaywright: Fast and provides support for multiple browsers.\nSelenium: Heavier, but behaviour is highly customizable\n\nEven though some are of the view that you should not test UI, I advise that you only test key components of your UI and not everything.\nBrowser tests are best suited if you have form submissions, interactive plots, or downloads in your Shiny application. A common rule of thumb is to test your logic thoroughly and UI sparingly and intentionally.\nYou can test critical workflows, such as file upload, file download, and data summary. Also, prioritize dynamic interactions over static levels, layout, or CSS."

    "text": "Common Pitfalls and Misconceptions\nAs you decide to implement TDD in your workflow, there are a lot of traps you can fall into. Here are some things you need to know.\n\nTDD doesn’t mean writing all tests first.\nA common misconception when implementing TDD is that you need to write all your tests first, which is not true.\nYou don’t have to write all your tests and account for all edge cases; you need to take TDD as a cycle, not a phase.\nYou write the minimum amount of code needed to pass a test, then you iterate. This ensures that you grow the system to ensure safety and clarity.\n\n\nIt’s not about perfection, but feedback loops.\nMost developers abandon TDD when they see their tests not covering everything, which misses the point of TDD.\nYou need to take TDD like a feedback loop, where you silently refactor your code without the fear of breaking things.\n\n\nOver-mocking, when your tests know too much\nWhen building reactive applications, mocking is handy. However, you can fall into the trap of mocking too much, which means your tests no longer reflect real user behavior.\nWhen this happens, your tests always pass because the mocks were rigged, not that the logic works. And when you change the implementation, your application might work while your tests break.\nOne way to determine if you are over-mocking is by mocking the same internal functions across multiple tests, or by having tests pass with broken logic due to the mock’s lack of realism."

    "text": "The Long-Term Payoff\nWhen starting your project, you might see TDD as a drag as you have to write tests and then ensure they pass, although in the long run, this is more beneficial for your workflow.\nTDD enables you to think in terms of small, testable units, and for Python Shiny applications that can evolve into complex interactive dashboards or data tools. TDD ensures that new changes don’t unexpectedly break existing behaviours.\nAs Shiny applications expand and become tightly coupled, TDD makes it easier to isolate, test, and maintain features.\nTDD also serves as your documentation, which evolves alongside your codebase. For Python Shiny applications, your tests can clarify expected data flow, user interactions, and reactive behaviours more effectively than a README.\n\nConclusion\nTDD is a fundamental way to build robust, interactive applications, and it’s possible. It enforces discipline on you and brings clarity when collaborating with others.\nBy writing tests first, you force your code to earn its place and stop guessing how your application behaves. Hence, every line matters, and every feature has its purpose. In this light, TDD is less about testing and more about designing software that meets its requirements.\n\n\nNeed Help with Data?

    "text": "Introduction\nAccording to WHO, the number of people with diabetes rose from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014. Diabetes is a serious disease that leads to blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, strokes, and lower limb amputations. It is mostly prevalent in low- and middle-income countries.\nBuilding a healthcare system that uses machine learning to predict patients with diabetes will help in early detection making it easy for healthcare providers to screen patients with diabetes at an early stage, before diagnosis.\n\nMachine learning models tend to degrade with time, highlighting the need for effective and constant monitoring of the model to know when its performance is declining. Often, this arises as a result of the change in the distribution of the data compared to the data the model was trained upon, this phenomenon is known as Data Drift.\nIn this article, you will learn how to monitor a diabetes classifier and detect data drifts in the data received from patients in a health information management system or mobile application using NannyML.\nNannyML is an open-source library for monitoring machine learning model performance in production, even without the predicted values being ready. It allows you to track your machine-learning model over time and see checkpoints where the model degrades."

The analysis set is the latest production data, either with target features or not.\nTraining a performance estimator on the reference set: NannyML uses the reference set to train a performance estimator, it’s advisable to use the test data as reference data to prevent overfitting.\nUsing the estimator to predict performance on the analysis set (simulating real-world data): NannyML estimates the model performance on the analysis data using the trained performance estimator. One can use various classification metrics, such as accuracy or F1-score. Since misclassifying a patient (false negative) is more severe than misclassifying a healthy patient as diabetic (false positive), the AUC-ROC is the most appropriate metric to use in this case."

    "text": "Detecting Data Drift with NannyML\nLet’s say you deployed a machine-learning model. As time goes on, the model tends to degrade, This is due to the nature of the data changing. If you have an application that you initially designed for kids and you train most of your machine learning models using your current user’s data, then all of a sudden middle-aged people and the elderly start using your application, and they become more of your users than the kids you designed it for. This will change the age distribution of your data, If age is one important feature in your machine learning model, your model will get worse with time. This is where you need to monitor when such changes happen in your data so that you can update the ML model.\n\nNannyML uses various algorithms to detect data drift, either using Univariate drift detection or Multivariate drift detection methods.\n\nUnivariate drift detection: In this approach, NannyML looks at each feature used in classifying if a patient is diabetic, and compares the chunks with those created from the analysis period. The result of the comparison is called a drift metric, and it is the amount of drift between the reference and analysis chunks, which is calculated for each chunk.\nMultivariate Drift Detection Instead of taking every feature one by one, NannyML provides a single summary metric explaining the drift between the reference and the analysis sets. Although this approach can detect slight changes in the data, it is difficult to explain compared to univariate drift.\n\nIn the case of classifying diabetic patients, undetected drift is dangerous and can lead to wrong model classifications. This is worse if the number of false negatives is high, the classifier might not detect some patients with diabetes, this can lead to late diagnosis."

    "section": "Estimating Model Performance in the Diabetes Classifier",
    "text": "Estimating Model Performance in the Diabetes Classifier\nNannyML uses two main approaches to estimate model performance, Confidence-based Performance estimation (CBPE) and Direct Loss estimation (DLE). In this case, we are interested in using the CBPE, since we are dealing with a classification task.\nThe CBPE uses the confidence score of the predictions to estimate the model performance, the confidence score is a value that the diabetes classifier gives for each predicted observation, expressing its confidence in predicting if a patient is diabetic., with values ranging from 0 to 1 and the closer it is to 1, the more confident the classifier is with it’s prediction.\nThe diabetes data contains 253,680 responses and 21 features. In this section, you will learn how to use this data to build an ML model, estimate your model’s performance, and detect data drift on updated data.\n\nProject Requirements\nTo get started, ensure you have installed NannyML on your JupyterNotebook. Download the analysis and diabetes data. The diabetes data is the data you will train the machine learning model on, and the analysis data is what you would take as the production data from the patients, which you will use to estimate model performance and detect data drift later on.\n\n\nBuilding the ML Model\nLet’s build a simple random forest classifier to classify respondents as diabetic.\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report\n\n# Load your data\ndiabetes = pd.read_csv(\"binary_diabetes.csv\")\n\n# Split the data into features (X) and target (y)\nX = diabetes.drop('Diabetes_binary', axis=1)\ny = diabetes['Diabetes_binary']\n\n# Split the data into train and test sets\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)\n\n# Create and train the model\nmodel = RandomForestClassifier()\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Make predictions on the test set\ny_pred = model.predict(X_test)\n\n# Get the predicted probabilities\ny_pred_proba = model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]  \n\n# Print the classification report\nprint(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))\n\n# Create a dataframe with the test data, predicted classes, and predicted probabilities\ntest_results = X_test.copy()\ntest_results['y_true'] = y_test\ntest_results['y_pred'] = y_pred\ntest_results['y_pred_prob'] = y_pred_proba\nHere is the output of the classification model.\n                                precision    recall  f1-score   support\n\n         0.0       0.88      0.97      0.92     65605\n         1.0       0.48      0.18      0.26     10499\n\n    accuracy                           0.86     76104\n   macro avg       0.68      0.57      0.59     76104\nweighted avg       0.83      0.86      0.83     76104\nFrom the report above, the classifier can classify those with diabetes with a precision of 0.88 accurately. This means the chances of the classifier missing a diabetic patient are low. An overall accuracy of 0.86 indicates the model is performing well.\n\n\nEstimating Model Performance\nUsing CBPE, you can estimate the model performance when in production, and the analysis data does not necessarily have to contain the target feature.\nimport nannyml as nml\n\nreference_df = test_results\nanalysis_df = pd.read_csv(\"/content/analysis_df.csv\")\n\nestimator = nml.CBPE(\n    y_pred_proba =\"y_pred_prob\",\n    y_pred = \"y_pred\",\n    y_true = \"y_true\",\n    problem_type = \"classification_binary\",\n    metrics = [\"roc_auc\"],\n    chunk_size = 3000\n)\n\nestimator.fit(reference_df)\nresults = estimator.estimate(analysis_df)\n\nmetric_fig = results.plot()\nmetric_fig.show()\n\nnml.CBPE calculates the CBPE and takes the argument, y_pred_proba the predicted probability, y_pred the predicted classification, y_true the actual classification.\nThe problem_type argument takes the type of classification one is interested in, binary classification in this case.\nResults in NannyML are presented per chunk, by aggregating the data to a single data point on the monitoring results; here I used a chunk of 3000.\n\nYou can use any other metric, but the roc-auc metric is preferred in this situation because this is a health problem and it tells us more about the ability of the classifier to detect true positives, to minimize the chance of missing any diabetic patient.\n\nThe plot above shows that the model ROC-AUC metric started to fail at some point, which led to inaccurate predictions. The blue marker indicates the model metric, if this line exceeds the upper or lower threshold in red, it raises an alert signifying a drift.\nThe next step is to see what causes the poor model performance in these chunks by applying various drift detection methods.\n\n\nDetecting Data Drift\nLet’s use a multivariate drift detection method to get a summary number that detects any changes in our data using the domain classifier approach. This provides a measure of discriminating the reference data from the examined chunk data. If there is no data drift, the datasets are not different giving a value of 0.5. The higher the drift, the higher the returned measure, with a value as high as 1. This method provides a general overview of data drift in the analysis data.\nnon_feature_columns = ['y_pred_proba', 'y_pred', 'y_true']\nfeature_column_names = [\n    col for col in reference_df.columns\n    if col not in non_feature_columns\n]\ncat_features = [feature for feature in feature_column_names if feature not in ['BMI', 'MentHlth', 'PhysHlth', 'Age']]\n\ncalc = nml.DomainClassifierCalculator(\n    feature_column_names=feature_column_names,\n    chunk_size=3000\n)\n\ncalc.fit(reference_df)\nresults = calc.calculate(analysis_df)\n\nfigure = results.plot()\nfigure.show()\n\nThe plot above shows the domain classifier values in the reference data are either a little below or above 0.5, but that of the analysis data reaches a value of 1, indicating the presence of data drift in the analysis data. Now that we know we have data drift in the analysis data, let’s see which features are causing this drift.\n\n\nRanking\nWe need to know the features contributing to drift in the analysis data. The ranking method uses the results of univariate drift detection to rank features based on alert counts or correlation ranking.\nLet’s use the alert count’s approach to know which features are causing the drift in data.\nuniv_calc = nml.UnivariateDriftCalculator(\n    column_names=feature_column_names,\n    treat_as_categorical=['y_pred', *cat_features],\n    continuous_methods=['kolmogorov_smirnov', 'jensen_shannon'],\n    categorical_methods=['chi2', 'jensen_shannon'],\n    chunk_size=3000\n)\n\nuniv_calc.fit(reference_df)\nunivariate_results = univ_calc.calculate(analysis_df)\n\nalert_count_ranker = nml.AertCountRanker()\nalert_count_ranked_features = alert_count_ranker.rank(\n    univariate_results.filter(methods=['jensen_shannon']),\n    only_drifting = False)\ndisplay(alert_count_ranked_features)\nkolmogorov_smirnov, jensen_shannonand chi2 are various univariate drift detection methods you can always choose from.\n\nThe table above shows the top 10 features likely to cause drifts based on the alert counts. Next, let’s investigate further the contribution to data drift for each variable using the univariate drift detection method.\n\n\nUnivariate Drift Detection Method\nUnivariate drift detection allows you to see the amount of drift in the suspected features, which was used earlier to rank the features.\nuniv_calc = nml.UnivariateDriftCalculator(\n    column_names=feature_column_names,\n    treat_as_categorical=['y_pred', *cat_features],\n    continuous_methods=['jensen_shannon'],\n    categorical_methods=['jensen_shannon'],\n    chunk_size=3000\n)\n\nuniv_calc.fit(reference_df)\nunivariate_results = univ_calc.calculate(analysis_df)\n\nfigure = univariate_results.filter(column_names=univariate_results.continuous_column_names, methods=['jensen_shannon']).plot(kind='drift')\nfigure.show()\n\nThe plots above show the amount of drift in some of the features using Jensen-Shannon distance, which you can apply to both continuous and categorical features. You can also see that the red dotted points exceed the dotted line in each plot, this signifies drift in the variable.\nYou can also go further into each feature to see the distribution, this lets you know how large this drift is Let’s take a critical look at PhyHlth, this is the first feature on the ranked list.\nfigure = univariate_results.filter(column_names=[\"PhysHlth\"], methods=['jensen_shannon']).plot(kind='distribution')\nfigure.show() \n\nFrom the plot, you can see in highlight chunks with data drift, the plot is wider and bigger compared to that of the reference data, the plot also tells the presence of negative values in the analysis data. You can follow this procedure for each feature in the model indicating data drift using the univariate drift detection method. From the above results, you can understand the change in model prediction and the cause of those changes."

    "text": "What is Linear Regression?\nLinear regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a continuous dependent variable(outcome) and one or more independent variables (predictors) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. This allows us to understand how the outcome variable changes to the predictor variables.\n\nTypes of linear regression\nWe have various types of linear regression.\n\nSimple Linear Regression: This examines the relationship between a single outcome variable and a single predictor variable.\nMultiple Linear Regression: This examines the relationship between a single outcome variable and multiple predictor variables.\n\n\n\nAssumptions of linear regression\nBefore conducting a linear regression, our data should meet some assumptions:\n\nLinearity: The relationship between the outcome and predictor variables is linear. You can check this by plotting a graph of the predictor variable against the outcome variable and ensuring that the points on the graph form a straight line.\nIndependence: Observations are independent of each other. That is, the occurrence of subsequent observations does not depend on the occurrence of previous observations. This is checked by observing the structure of the data or how the data was collected.\nHomoscedasticity: The variance of the errors is constant across all levels of the independent variables. The difference between predicted and actual values is almost the same in all observations. The Breusch-Pagan test is one way to check for this assumption.\nNormality: The outcome variable is normally distributed. That is, its graph should have a curve similar to a bell-shaped curve. You can check for this assumption by plotting the graph of the outcome variable.\nNo Multicollinearity: In the case of multiple linear regression, independent variables are not highly correlated. If you have two predictors having a strong relationship, you need to drop one and select the other for your model. There are various ways of checking for this, such as using the correlation matrix or checking the variance inflation factor (VIF)."

If one of the plots were to show a curve shape, we would have to drop that predictor since it violates the assumption of linearity.\n\n\nIndependence\nWe can find this out from the nature of the data. For example, you have observations recorded based on time, such as hourly, daily, and so on. We can say these observations depend on each other, as we can’t have the next observation unless the previous one has already been recorded. However, in the case of the mpg dataset, the observations are drawn from various vehicles and are independent of each other. We can say that this particular assumption of independence is satisfied.\n\n\nNormality\nYou can check this assumption by plotting a density plot of the outcome variable.\nsns.kdeplot(y)\nplt.xlabel('mpg')\nplt.ylabel('Density')\nplt.title('Density Plot of mpg')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nCheck for normality of the outcome variable.

However, this approach has a lot of setbacks:\n\nIf a patient has not relapsed by the end of the study, their time is censored. We have to either exclude these patients from the study, which can lead to biased estimates, or treat these censored patients as if they had relapsed before the study’s end, which is incorrect.\nThe risk of relapse is not constant over time, which means the model does not account for the fact that patients might be at different risks at different times.\nThe data may or may not be normally distributed, and linear regression assumes the normality of errors.\nFor logistic regression, it only tells us if a patient relapsed or not but does not tell us when the relapse happened.\n\nSurvival analysis is designed explicitly for time-dependent data and addresses all the above setbacks of traditional regression models. It is a branch of statistics that focuses on analyzing the time until an event of interest occurs. This event can be death, disease relapse, equipment failure, customer churn, or any other time-dependent event."

    "section": "Case Study: Employee Churn",
    "text": "Case Study: Employee Churn\nIn this article, we will use the Telco customer churn dataset to demonstrate how to perform a Kaplan-Meier estimation by estimating customer retention and also find out which categories of customer type are likely to churn. Before loading the data, ensure the following libraries are installed.\n\npandas\nmatplotlib\nlifelines\n\nLet’s add the following imports, load the data, and preview the main variables of interest.\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\n\ntelco_df = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/telco-customer-churn/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv\")\ntelco_df.loc[:,[\"tenure\",\"Churn\"]].head()\n\n\n\nPreview of the tenure and Churn variables. Image by Author.\n\n\nFor a survival analysis, we are interested in two key variables, event and time, which are Churn and tenure in the dataset, where tenure is measured in months.\nRecode the Churn variable, so 1 represents churn, while 0 represents censoring. Censoring, in this case, means that a customer might churn in the future.\ntelco_df[\"Churn\"] = telco_df[\"Churn\"].map({\"No\":0,\"Yes\":1})\ntelco_df.loc[:,[\"tenure\",\"Churn\"]].head() \n\n\n\nRecode Churn variable into numeric format. Image by Author.\n\n\nRename the tenure and Churn variables to time and event. This is unnecessary, but it is just to make it easy to relate to the concepts discussed earlier.\ntime = telco_df[\"tenure\"]\nevent = telco_df[\"Churn\"]\n\nKaplan-Meier Estimation\nImport the KaplanMeierFitter() class from the lifelines library to perform a Kaplan-Meier estimation. Then, we create an instance of the class and fit it into our data.\nfrom lifelines import KaplanMeierFitter\n\nkmf = KaplanMeierFitter()\nkmf.fit(time, event_observed=event)\nYou can get the Kaplan-Meier estimate for each timeline by calling the survival_function_ method on the kmf object.\nkmf.survival_function_\n\n\n\nKaplan-Meier estimate for each timeline. Image by Author.\n\n\nYou can also get a plot of these values by calling the plot_survival_function method.\nkmf.plot_survival_function()\nplt.title(\"Survival function of customer churn\")\n\n\n\nSurvival function of customer churn. Image by Author.\n\n\n\n\nSurvival Estimate by Group\nWhat if we are interested in seeing the survival plots of various groups in the dataset? You can achieve this by filtering and fitting a survival function for each group and combining it into a single plot. For example, let’s see the survival plot of customers based on whether they have partners or not.\npartner = telco_df[\"Partner\"]\nix = (partner == \"Yes\")\n\nkmf.fit(time[~ix], event[~ix], label = \"No\")\nax = kmf.plot_survival_function()\n\nkmf.fit(time[ix], event[ix], label = \"Yes\")\nax = kmf.plot_survival_function()\n\n\n\nSurvival plot based on if customers have partners or not. Image by Author.\n\n\nFor variables with more than two groups, you can follow the following approach. Let’s examine each group based on PaymentMethod and see which payment method group will have the highest retention.\npayment_methods = telco_df[\"PaymentMethod\"].unique()\n\nfor i, payment_method in enumerate(payment_methods):\n    ax = plt.subplot(2, 3, i + 1)\n\n    ix = telco_df['PaymentMethod'] == payment_method\n    kmf.fit(time[ix], event[ix], label=payment_method)\n    kmf.plot_survival_function(ax=ax, legend=False)\n\n    plt.title(payment_method)\n    plt.xlim(0, 50)\n\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n\n\nSurvival estimates by payment method. Image by Author.\n\n\n\n\nAdd a Descriptive Table Below the Plot\nWhen publishing results, following the plots with descriptive tables is encouraged. This table shows the number of customers who will churn at various time intervals, censored customers, and customers at risk of churning.\npartner = telco_df[\"Partner\"]\nix = (partner == \"Yes\")\n\nax = plt.subplot(111)\n\nkmf_yes = KaplanMeierFitter()\nax = kmf_yes.fit(telco_df.loc[ix][\"tenure\"], telco_df.loc[ix][\"Churn\"],label = \"Yes\").plot_survival_function(ax = ax)\n\nkmf_no = KaplanMeierFitter()\nax = kmf_no.fit(telco_df.loc[~ix][\"tenure\"], telco_df.loc[~ix][\"Churn\"],label = \"No\").plot_survival_function(ax = ax)\n\nfrom lifelines.plotting import add_at_risk_counts\nadd_at_risk_counts(kmf_yes, kmf_no, ax=ax)\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n\n\nSurvival estimate by partners with descriptive table. Image by Author.\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting Kaplan-Meier Plots\nInterpreting the Kaplan-Meier plot is easy since it’s a descriptive statistical methodology. Let’s take a look at the first plot we had.\n\n\n\nSurvival estimate at mid-duration and end of timeline. Image by Author.\n\n\nIn the plot above, the y-axis represents the number of customers remaining at a given time. The survival probability starts at 1 (100%) at time 0, meaning all customers are present initially. As time progresses, the likelihood of customer retention decreases. The downward trend shows that customer retention is continuous over time.\nThe shaded area indicates the confidence interval for the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis estimate, where a narrower band implies higher confidence and a wider band suggests more uncertainty. Around 75% of customers remain by mid-duration (1). At the end of the timeline, 60% of customers are still active (2), showing that the business retains a significant portion of customers over the period.\n\n\n\nSurvival estimate by partners. Image by Author.\n\n\nThe plot above groups the previous plot into two categories: those with and without partners. The orange curve represents those with partners, while the blue represents those without partners.\nThose with partners have a higher retention probability than those without partners. Their survival probability is around 70% by the end of the timeline.\nThose without partners exhibit a steeper decline in survival probability, indicating they are more likely to churn faster. By the end of the timeline, their survival probability is approximately 45%.\nThis gap between the two curves highlights that the presence of a partner is a significant factor influencing customer retention.\nThe table below the plot further explains the plot. At time zero, the starting population was 3,393 customers with partners and 3,639 without partners. Nine were censored with zero events for customers with partners, while two were censored with zero events for those without partners.\nAt the end of the timeline, 452 customers with partners are at risk of churning, 2,292 have been censored, and 658 churned. For those without partners, 80 are at risk of churning, 2,362 have been censored, and 1,199 have churned.\nThese results show that customers with partners have a higher retention rate than those without partners. This could be due to shared decision-making or factors like excellent financial stability or dual service usage.\n\n\n\nSurvival estimate by payment methods. Image by Author.\n\n\nThe plot above also compares customer retention across four different payment methods. Electronic checks show the poorest retention rate, with a sharp initial and continuous decline. By timeline 50, with a customer retention rate of about 45%.\nMailed check customers show better retention than electronic check users but still demonstrate concerning churn patterns. Starting with a sharp initial drop, the curve continues to decline more gradually, reaching about 75% retention by the end of the period. This suggests that while mailed check users are more stable than electronic check users, they still represent a higher risk group than automatic payment methods.\nBank transfer (automatic) shows strong retention patterns. The curve declines gradually, maintaining approximately 85% retention by the end of the observation period. This suggests that customers who set up automatic bank transfers are significantly more likely to remain loyal customers.\nCredit card (automatic) payments show similarly strong retention patterns to automatic bank transfers. The survival curve remains high, ending at roughly 85% retention. The gradual decline and narrow confidence intervals suggest that automatic credit card payments, like automatic bank transfers, are associated with more stable, long-term customer relationships.\nOverall, a clear pattern shows that automatic payment methods (bank transfer and credit card) are associated with significantly better customer retention than manual payment methods (electronic and mailed checks)."

This is precisely the type of problem Docker was created to solve.\nAlthough the term Docker is not new to you, understanding its potential to streamline Shiny application development and deployment is a game-changer.\nYou might wonder, “Why bother with Docker? Shiny applications aren’t that complex.”\nTrue, they are not the most complicated pieces of software, but that’s not the point. The real question is: how can you make deploying your application smoother, faster, and more reliable, no matter where it runs?\nWhen you view it from the angle of convenience and consistency, the benefits of Docker become much clearer.\nDocker brings three significant advantages to the table: portability, reproducibility, and simplified deployment. With Docker, you can package your Shiny application along with all its dependencies into a single container.\nThis means you can run it on any system without worrying about missing packages, version mismatches, or other environmental issues. You can even switch hosting providers with minimal effort, sidestepping the pain of vendor lock-in.\nTo help you get started, I’ve put together this practical and straightforward guide, designed to show you step-by-step how you can package, test, and launch your Shiny application using Docker."

    "text": "Step-by-Step Process\n\nStep 1 – Create a Dockerfile\nTo containerize your application, you need to create a Dockerfile. This Dockerfile is what you will use to create an image.\nTake your Dockerfile as the blueprint for a building, while the final product, which is the Docker Image, is the completed building.\nDocker uses your Dockerfile as a step-by-step process in building your Shiny application Image.\nIn your project directory, create a new file Dockerfile .Then, copy and paste the code below.\nFROM python:3.11-slim\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY requirements.txt .\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt\nCOPY . .\nCMD [\"shiny\", \"run\", \"--host\", \"0.0.0.0\", \"--port\", \"8000\", \"app.py\"]\nLet’s break down the code above.\n\nFROM python:3.11-slim instructs Docker to use a Python base image with version 3.11. The-slim tag tells Docker to use a lightweight Python version.\nWORKDIR /app sets the working directory inside the container to /app.\nCOPY requirements.txt . copies the requirements.txt into the current directory within the container.\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt installs all Python dependencies into the container. The -- no-cache-dir avoids storing pip’s cache inside the image to reduce the image size.\nCOPY . . Copies the entire local project directory into the /app directory in the container.\nCMD [\"shiny\", \"run\", \"--host\", \"0.0.0.0\", \"--port\", \"8000\", \"[app.py](http://app.py/)\"] sets the default command to run when the container starts on the host 0.0.0.0 and port 8000.\n\n\n\nStep 2 – Build the Docker Image\nUse the command below to build the Docker Image.\ndocker build -t shiny-python-app .\n\n\n\nBuild your Dockerfile. Image by Author.\n\n\nIf the build was successful, you should see a message similar to the following.\n\n\n\nRun the Docker Image. Image by Author.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3 – Run the Container\nA Container is an instance of an Image; this implies that an Image can spawn many containers.\nRun the command below to run the container.\ndocker run -p 8000:8000 shiny-python-app\nYou will see your application available at http://localhost:8000\n\n\n\nStep 4 – Push to Docker Hub\nFirst of all, you have to log in to Docker Hub if you are not logged in, run the command below.\ndocker login\n\n\n\nLogin to Docker. Image by Author.\n\n\nIf you want to push an Image to Docker Hub, you need to specify your username and the Image tag using the following format during builds; &lt;your-user-name&gt;/&lt;your-app-name&gt;:&lt;tag&gt;.\nThe tag is a label you give to various versions of your Image.\ndocker build -t adejumoridwan/shiny-python-app:latest .\nFinally, push the Image to Docker Hub.\ndocker push adejumoridwan/shiny-python-app:latest\nGo to the My Hub tab on your Docker Hub dashboard, and you should see your published Image.\n\n\n\nGo to Docker Hub.

    "text": "Notes When Building Docker Applications\nThere are some points you need to take note of when building your application:\n\nUse .dockerignore to keep your build clean\nA .dockerignore is just like .gitignore. It instructs Docker not to copy the specified files into the image.\nThis is important because when you run docker build ., it will copy all files in your entire directory unless you explicitly exclude them.\nFor your Shiny application, you would want to exclude things like; __pycache__/, .pytest_cache/, .git , venv/ and so on.\nMost of the above files are usually huge and can increase the size of your image.\nHere is an example of a .dockerignore file.\n__pycache__/\n*.pyc\n*.pyo\n*.pyd\n*.log\n*.db\n.venv/\n.env\n.git\n.gitignore\nDockerfile\ndocker-compose.yml\n\n\nUse multi-stage builds for smaller images\nIn multi-stage builds, you separate your build environment from the runtime environment.\nIn your Shiny applications, you can:\n\nInstall dependencies, compile wheels, or build your frontend assets if you have them.\nCopy only the necessary runtime files (app code + installed dependencies) into a slimmer base image like python:3.11-slim.\n\nHere is an example of a multi-stage build, where the runtime Python environment is a lightweight version of the build Python environment.\n# Stage 1: Build environment\nFROM python:3.11 AS builder\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY requirements.txt .\nRUN pip install --user -r requirements.txt\n\n# Stage 2: Final runtime\nFROM python:3.11-slim\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Copy dependencies from builder\nCOPY --from=builder /root/.local /root/.local\n\n# Update PATH for installed packages\nENV PATH=/root/.local/bin:$PATH\n\n# Copy only necessary app files\nCOPY app.py .\n\n# Run shiny app\nCMD [\"shiny\", \"run\", \"--host\", \"0.0.0.0\", \"--port\", \"8000\", \"app.py\"]\n\n\nEnsure your app binds to 0.0.0.0 inside Docker.\nBy default, your Shiny application binds to 127.0.0.1 which is your localhost, but inside Docker, 127.0.0.1 means the content is only accessible inside the container, which implies your host machine won’t be able to reach it.\nTo make your application accessible outside your container, bind it to all interfaces, using the command below.\nshiny run --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 app.py"

    "text": "In a world driven by data, accuracy is crucial for informing business decisions, shaping public policy, or guiding scientific research; even a minor error in a dataset can lead to significant consequences. A misplaced decimal, a missing value, or a wrong assumption can quickly spiral into misinformation, financial loss, or damaged reputations.\nWe’ve seen it happen: news headlines expose flawed reports, insufficient data erodes public trust, and organizations scramble to correct errors that could have been caught early. These real-world data scandals highlight a critical truth: ensuring accuracy isn’t just a technical task; it’s a responsibility.\nThat’s where tools like R come in. With the proper practices and built-in features, R empowers analysts and data scientists to spot issues before they escalate, helping prevent the next headline-making blunder.\nIn 2012, JP Morgan Chase suffered a $6 billion trading loss, partly attributed to errors in an Excel risk model. The model contained manual copy-paste errors and formula mistakes, resulting in an underestimation of potential losses. This incident highlights the risks associated with relying on complex spreadsheets without rigorous checks and balances."

    "text": "Why R?\n\nR as a tool for data analysis and validation\nR is a powerful environment specifically built for data analysis, statistical computing, and visualization. What sets R apart is its strong focus on data integrity and reproducibility, making it an excellent choice for catching and correcting errors before they become costly.\nRegarding data validation, R offers many tools to clean, inspect, and audit datasets. Analysts can write scripts to automate checks, identify anomalies, and enforce consistency across large data sets. Unlike manual spreadsheet work, R encourages repeatable workflows, reducing the risk of human error.\nR’s active ecosystem includes packages like dplyr, readr, janitor, and assertr, each designed to streamline the process of identifying and handling dirty or flawed data, such as checking for missing values, outliers, or logic inconsistencies.\n\n\nBuilt-in features for error detection\nR offers a robust set of built-in features and packages designed to detect and prevent data errors before they escalate into significant issues.\nFunctions such as summary(), str(), and head() enable you to quickly inspect the structure and contents of your data. These commands can reveal missing values, unexpected data types, or unusual ranges; all red flags that something may be amiss.\nR also provides clear warnings and error messages when something goes wrong during code execution. For example, if you attempt a calculation on incompatible data types, R will alert you with informative feedback, making it easier to diagnose and fix the issue.\nAdditionally, tools like is.na() help identify missing values, while functions such as duplicated() and anyDuplicated() catch repeated entries that could skew results. Logical checks such as all(), any(), and stopifnot() enforce rules and conditions in your workflow, effectively acting as built-in safeguards.\nFor more advanced needs, R offers specialized packages such as assert, validate, and testthat, which formalize and automate error detection and testing routines."

    "text": "Common Error Types\nWhen working with data, mistakes can come from many sources. Recognizing standard error types is the first step toward preventing them from affecting your analysis:\n\nData Entry Errors: Manual data entry is prone to typos, incorrect formats, and misclassifications. For example, entering “220” instead of “22” for age, or misspelling a category as “Femle” instead of “Female,” can create false patterns in analysis.\nMissing or Inconsistent Values: Missing data is frequent, especially when combining datasets from multiple sources. Gaps can appear as NA, empty strings, or zero values, requiring different handling. Inconsistencies, like mixing “Yes/No” with “Y/N”, can make grouping or summarizing data difficult.\nLogical Inconsistencies: These errors occur when data contradicts itself. For instance, a record showing a person’s birthdate after their date of death, or a student listed as “graduated” but with no courses completed. Such issues often go unnoticed until they cause problems in the analysis or report."

    "text": "Base R Functions for Preliminary Checks\n\nsummary()\nThe summary() function gives a quick statistical summary of each column in a data frame, For factors, it shows the frequency of each level; for logical it shows the counts of TRUEs and FALSEs, while for numeric data it shows the:\n\nminimum\nfirst quartile\nmedian\nmean\nthird quartile\nmaximum\n\nIt is used to quickly identify outliers or unexpected values. Here is an example using the iris data.\nsummary(iris)\n\n\n\nsummary() of the iris data. Image by Author.\n\n\n\n\nstr()\nThe str() function reveals the internal structure of an R object, displaying information such as data types and sample values for each variable, as well as the number of observations and variables.\nBefore proceeding with the analysis, you should use str() to understand the kind of data you are handling.\nstr(iris)\n\n\n\nstr() revealing the structure of the iris dataset. Image by Author.\n\n\n\n\nis.na()\nis.na() function detects missing values (NA) in your data, returning a logical vector of TRUE where values are NA, and FALSE otherwise. It checks for incomplete data, which can affect analysis or model performance.\nsum(is.na(iris))  # Count total missing values\n\n\n\nTotal missing values in the iris dataset. Image by Author.\n\n\n\n\nduplicated()\nThe duplicated() function identifies duplicate rows or elements and returns a logical vector indicating which entries are duplicated. This is useful for cleaning datasets and flagging potential data entry issues.\nduplicated(iris)        # Shows which rows are duplicates\niris[duplicated(iris), ]  # Displays duplicate rows\n\n\n\nNumber of duplicated values in each column of the iris dataset. Image by Author.\n\n\n\n\nExternal Packages\nOther external packages extend what R does in terms of detecting errors.\n\nvalidate package\nThe validate package lets users define and apply custom validation rules to datasets. For example:\nlibrary(validate)\n\n# Define validation rules for iris\n# For example:\n# - Sepal.Length and Sepal.Width should be positive\n# - Species should be one of the known species in iris\nrules &lt;- validator(\n  Sepal.Length &gt; 0,\n  Sepal.Width &gt; 0,\n  Species %in% c(\"setosa\", \"versicolor\", \"virginica\")\n)\n\n# Apply the rules to the iris dataset\nconfronted &lt;- confront(iris, rules)\n\n# Summarize the results of the validation\nsummary(confronted)\n\n\n\nSummary of the results validation using the validator package. Image by Author.\n\n\nThis approach helps systematically identify records that violate predefined conditions, ensuring data consistency and reliability.\n\n\nassertr package\nassertr provides a pipeline-friendly syntax for asserting conditions on data frames. It integrates seamlessly with dplyr and checks assumptions within data processing workflows. For example:\n# Load necessary packages\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(assertr)\n\n# Use dplyr pipeline and assert conditions on iris data\niris |&gt;\n  # Assert Sepal.Length is positive\n  assert(within_bounds(0, Inf), Sepal.Length) |&gt;\n  \n  # Assert Sepal.Width is positive\n  assert(within_bounds(0, Inf), Sepal.Width) |&gt;\n  \n  # Assert Species is one of the valid species\n  assert(in_set(c(\"setosa\", \"versicolor\", \"virginica\")), Species) |&gt;\n  \n  # Select only Sepal measurements\n  select(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Species)\n\n\n\nImplementation of the assert package. Image by Author.\n\n\n\n\ncheckmate package\nThe checkmate package is designed for defensive programming, offering a suite of functions to validate function arguments and data structures. It ensures that inputs meet expected criteria before further processing, reducing the risk of runtime errors. Here is an example using the iris dataset:\n# Load the checkmate package\nlibrary(checkmate)\n\n# Define a function that processes iris data\nprocess_iris_data &lt;- function(data) {\n  \n  # Defensive checks using checkmate\n  assert_data_frame(data, any.missing = FALSE, min.rows = 1)\n  assert_names(names(data), must.include = c(\"Sepal.Length\", \"Sepal.Width\", \"Species\"))\n  assert_numeric(data$Sepal.Length, lower = 0)\n  assert_numeric(data$Sepal.Width, lower = 0)\n  assert_factor(data$Species, levels = c(\"setosa\", \"versicolor\", \"virginica\"))\n  \n  # Continue processing safely after checks\n  summary_stats &lt;- summary(data)\n  return(summary_stats)\n}\n\n# Apply the function to the iris dataset\nprocess_iris_data(iris)\n\n\n\nImplementation of the checkmate package. Image by Author.\n\n\n\n\ndata.validator package\nDeveloped by Appsilon, the data.validator enables the creation of automated data quality reports. It facilitates the communication of data validation results to stakeholders, generating reports which you can export into HTML, CSV, and TXT formats. For example:\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(data.validator)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n# Initialize the report\nreport &lt;- data_validation_report()\n\n# Add validation steps\nvalidate(iris) %&gt;%\n  validate_cols(description = \"Sepal.Length is numeric\", predicate = is.numeric, cols = Sepal.Length) %&gt;%\n  validate_cols(description = \"Sepal.Width is numeric\", predicate = is.numeric, cols = Sepal.Width) %&gt;%\n  validate_cols(description = \"Petal.Length is numeric\", predicate = is.numeric, cols = Petal.Length) %&gt;%\n  validate_cols(description = \"Petal.Width is numeric\", predicate = is.numeric, cols = Petal.Width) %&gt;%\n  validate_cols(description = \"Species is a factor\", predicate = is.factor, cols = Species) %&gt;%\n  validate_if(description = \"No missing values in Sepal.Length\", Sepal.Length %&gt;% is.na() %&gt;% not()) %&gt;%\n  validate_if(description = \"Sepal.Length &gt; 0\", Sepal.Length &gt; 0) %&gt;%\n  validate_if(description = \"Sepal.Width &gt; 0\", Sepal.Width &gt; 0) %&gt;%\n  add_results(report)\n \n report\n\n\n\nImplementation of the data.validator package.

Tools like roxygen2 can help document functions.\nAutomate Checks Early: Build validation rules into your workflow from the beginning, not as an afterthought. Use packages like validate, assertr, and checkmate to set up automated gates for bad data.\nTest Regularly: Use testthat to create unit tests for your functions and workflows. Testing small components ensures that failures are caught early.\nUse Version Control: Track your scripts and data validation logic using Git. Integrating Git with RStudio enables you to track changes, collaborate with teammates, and roll back changes if something goes wrong.\nLog and Monitor Data Quality: Set up periodic reports or dashboards that highlight rule violations using tools like data.validator.\nCreate Reusable Validation Templates: Develop standardized validation templates that can be easily adapted to new datasets, particularly for recurring tasks."

By integrating validation checks into their R scripts, public health teams quickly caught inconsistent age brackets, duplicate case IDs, and conflicting test result entries, avoiding flawed metrics in official reports.\nSilent Data Corruption in RNA-Seq Analysis: A computational biologist encountered silent data corruption during differential gene expression analysis. The issue stemmed from a buggy error message in a package, a malformed input file, and unexpected behavior in R’s conversion from factor to integer. Quality control functions within R helped identify and rectify these subtle errors.\nIndependent Quality Control in Clinical Studies: In a medical device study, R was used to perform independent quality control by generating reporting datasets and statistical outputs. Utilizing packages like tidyverse, admiral, and Tplyr, this approach provided an additional layer of assurance by cross-validating results obtained through different programming languages."

This is why writing tests in your Python Shiny applications is essential.\nOne such test is end-to-end tests (E2E). End-to-end tests help mimic user interactions on an application, such as clicking buttons, file uploads, and browser variations, to ensure that the application’s user interface is working as expected.\nThis article will teach you how to conduct end-to-end tests on your Python Shiny applications using Playwright, an open-source automation framework for testing web applications."

It automates browser interactions with an application, just as a user would if they were to use the application. Playwright was built on Node.js but is also available as a Python library.\n\nBenefits of End-to-end testing with Playwright.\n\nWide Support and Compatibility: Playwright works with almost all operating systems and major browsers and has libraries in major programming languages.\nResilience and Dynamic Wait Times: Some elements or interactions can take time to load. Playwright features auto-wait for these elements or interactions, hence preventing unnecessary timeouts.\nTest Isolation: Playwright simulates a browser environment in a new tab. This allows you to run multiple tests on different sessions of the applications."

This ensures anyone viewing the code understands what’s going on. Make sure the names of the test functions relate to the function of the application being tested.\nConduct Cross-browser Testing: Ensure you test all relevant browsers to ensure users can access your applications from various browsers.\nAutomate Tests: Ensure you integrate CI/CD workflows into your code, using tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Circle CI, and others to run automated tests anytime a commit is made."

This ensures the app always has a ready-to-use model, either loaded or freshly trained, upon startup.\nCopy and paste the following code also.\n@app.get(\"/\")\ndef read_root():\n    \"\"\"Root endpoint\"\"\"\n    return {\"message\": \"Welcome to the Restaurant Tip Predictor API\"}\nThe code above defines a simple HTTP GET endpoint at the application’s root URL (\"/\"), using the @app.get(\"/\") decorator.\nThe function read_root() is called whenever someone accesses the root path. It returns a JSON response containing a message: {\"message\": \"Welcome to the Restaurant Tip Predictor API\"}.\nThis serves as a basic welcome or health check endpoint to confirm that the API is running and reachable.

It converts the request data into a dictionary and then a Pandas DataFrame.\nThe columns of the DataFrame are reordered to match the expected order defined by the global feature_names. If any required feature is missing, it raises a 400 Bad Request error using an HTTPException.\nOnce the input is validated and properly formatted, the function uses the pre-loaded machine learning model to predict the tip amount, rounds the prediction to two decimal places, and returns it as a TipPredictionResponse object.\nTo be able to run the model API, copy and paste the following code at the end of your app.py file.\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    try:\n        model = joblib.load(\"tip_predictor_model.joblib\")\n        feature_names = joblib.load(\"feature_names.joblib\")\n    except:\n        print(\"No model found.

It runs only when the script is executed directly, not when imported as a module.\nIt first tries to load a pre-trained model and its feature names using joblib. If the files are not found or loading fails, they don’t exist; it catches the exception and trains a new model by calling prepare_and_train_model().\nAfter that, it starts a FastAPI server using uvicorn, binding it to all network interfaces 0.0.0.0 on port 8000 with auto-reload enabled. This is helpful for development as it restarts the server when code changes."

    "text": "Enhancing the histogram\nYou can improve the histogram by providing some of the arguments explained in the previous section.\n\nAdjusting bin sizes and width\nCurrently, the default number of bins is set to auto based on the number of observations, and the bandwidth is set to None by default.\n\nNote\nUsing a bin width overrides the bins argument.\n\nLet’s increase the number of bins by giving a higher value, say 100.\nsns.histplot(data=tips, x='tip', bins=100)\nAlternatively, you can set the binwidth to 0.1, you will still get the same plot.\nsns.histplot(data=tips, x='tip', binwidth=0.1)\n\n\n\nAdjust the bin size or bandwidth to spread or thin the distribution. Image by Author.\n\n\n\n\nChanging the bin color\nTo set the bin’s color, add a value to the color argument. Let’s give the histogram the color green.\nsns.histplot(data=tips, x='tip', color=\"green\")\nplt.title(\"Distribution of tips received by the waiter\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Tip amount\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Frequency\")\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nAdd a color to the histogram. Image by Author.\n\n\n\n\nAdd a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)\nTo ease interpretation, we can set the kde argument to True. This will apply a kernel density estimation that smooths the histogram points, revealing the shape of the distribution.\nsns.histplot(data=tips, x='tip', color=\"green\", kde=True)\nplt.title(\"Distribution of tips received by the waiter\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Tip amount\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Frequency\")\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nSet kde to true. Image by Author\n\n\n\n\nAdd grouping variables\nYou can add a grouping variable to the histogram to see the distribution for each respective group. For example, let’s group the histogram by sex by adding a sex group to the hue argument to see the distribution of tips given by male and female customers.\n\nNote\nThis is going to override the color argument you specified earlier.\n\nsns.histplot(data=tips, x='tip', color=\"green\", kde=True, hue=\"sex\")\nplt.title(\"Distribution of tips received by the waiter\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Tip amount\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Frequency\")\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nAdd a group variable to the histogram.

We can deduce from our histogram that the most frequent amount of tips received by the waiter ranges from $2 to $3.\n\n\n\nIdentifying frequently occurring values through the plot peak. Image by Author.\n\n\nThe tail of the kernel density plot indicates extreme values. The longer the tail, the more extreme values present in the data are. This tail is referred to as a skew. A long tail to the left means the distribution is left-skewed. A long tail to the right means the histogram distribution is right-skewed, just like in the case of our plot. This means the waiter received tips above $6 from a few customers.\n\n\n\nIdentifying the skewness of the histogram plot. Image by Author.\n\n\nThe difference between the two kernel density plots also tells us that male customers give higher tips to the waiter than female customers, though the number of male customers is greater than that of female customers. The minimum tip the waiter receives is $1, while the highest is $10.\n\n\n\nDifference between the two KDE plots. Image by Author."

Inspired by Nicola Rennie’s brilliant work in the messy R package, this tool is ideal for data scientists, educators, and developers who want to stress-test their data pipelines or teach data cleaning in a controlled environment."

    "text": "Key Criteria for Selection\nWhen selecting a library for missing data imputation, ensure you look at the following criteria.\n\nEase of use and documentation quality: Ensure the library is not complex, it’s easy to use with well-written documentation. The library explains all the imputation algorithms used, and also the functions for implementing them. This makes it easy to know the right scenario to use a particular imputation method.\nSupport for different imputation methods: Some data might warrant simpler methods, while others will need complex imputation methods. You should use libraries that have a wide range of support for various simple and advanced methods. This keeps your workflow lean and simple, and avoids using multiple libraries.\nIntegration with popular data science workflows: Some popular Python libraries already support various imputation methods, hence avoiding the need for an external library. Some missing data imputation libraries also make it easy to integrate well with classes and functions from other Python libraries, making it easy to add to your workflow.\nCommunity support and performance: You want to make sure you are using a library with a lot of help and support online, and it’s also actively maintained. Whenever you get stuck, you can easily reach out for help."

    "section": "Python Libraries for Missing Data Imputation",
    "text": "Python Libraries for Missing Data Imputation\nLet’s look at some of the libraries you can use for missing data imputation.\n\n1. Pandas\nPandas is one of the most popular libraries among data professionals working with Python. Designed for data wrangling, it comes with various imputation methods, mostly for simple use cases. It’s easy to use, fast, and well-integrated for exploratory data analysis.\nHere are some of its built-in methods for missing data imputation:\n\nfillna(): replaces missing values in a dataframe either by the mean, median, or a custom value.\ninterpolate(): fills missing values by interpolating between existing data points, essentially estimating values between known ones.\ndropna(): removes rows or columns that contain missing (NaN) values.\n\nExamples\nHere are some examples demonstrating the above functions.\n\nfillna() :\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    'A': [1, 2, None, 4],\n    'B': [None, 2, 3, None]\n})\n\nprint(\"Original DataFrame:\")\nprint(df)\n\n# Replace NaN with 0\ndf_filled = df.fillna(0)\nprint(\"\\nAfter fillna(0):\")\nprint(df_filled)\n\n# Forward fill (propagate last valid value forward)\ndf_ffill = df.fillna(method='ffill')\nprint(\"\\nAfter forward fill:\")\nprint(df_ffill)\nOriginal DataFrame:\n     A    B\n0  1.0  NaN\n1  2.0  2.0\n2  NaN  3.0\n3  4.0  NaN\n\nAfter fillna(0):\n     A    B\n0  1.0  0.0\n1  2.0  2.0\n2  0.0  3.0\n3  4.0  0.0\n\nAfter forward fill:\n     A    B\n0  1.0  NaN\n1  2.0  2.0\n2  2.0  3.0\n3  4.0  3.0\nIn the first missing value imputation, the missing values are filled with 0 , while in the second missing value imputation, they are filled with the value of the observation in the previouis row.\ninterpolate():\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    'A': [1, None, 3, None, 5]\n})\n\nprint(\"Original DataFrame:\")\nprint(df)\n\n# Linear interpolation\ndf_interp = df.interpolate()\nprint(\"\\nAfter interpolation:\")\nprint(df_interp)\nOriginal DataFrame:\n     A\n0  1.0\n1  NaN\n2  3.0\n3  NaN\n4  5.0\n\nAfter interpolation:\n     A\n0  1.0\n1  2.0\n2  3.0\n3  4.0\n4  5.0\nThere .interpolate() method supports various types of interpolation, but the example above used a linear interpolation whereby the missing values are filled with the assumption that they change at a constant rate between two points, either an increase by 1,2, and so on.\ndropna():\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    'A': [1, None, 3, 4],\n    'B': [None, 2, None, 4]\n})\n\nprint(\"Original DataFrame:\")\nprint(df)\n\n# Drop rows with any NaN values\ndf_drop_any = df.dropna()\nprint(\"\\nAfter dropna() (any NaN):\")\nprint(df_drop_any)\n\n# Drop columns with any NaN values\ndf_drop_col = df.dropna(axis=1)\nprint(\"\\nAfter dropna(axis=1):\")\nprint(df_drop_col)\nOriginal DataFrame:\n     A    B\n0  1.0  NaN\n1  NaN  2.0\n2  3.0  NaN\n3  4.0  4.0\n\nAfter dropna() (any NaN):\n     A    B\n3  4.0  4.0\n\nAfter dropna(axis=1):\nEmpty DataFrame\nColumns: []\nIndex: [0, 1, 2, 3]\nJust as it’s shown in the example above, you can apply dropna() , either row or column-wise, to drop missing observations from your data.\n\n\n\n\n2. Scikit-learn\nScikit-learn, which is popular for machine learning, also has various classes for handling missing data imputations. This makes it easy to implement missing data imputation in both the train and test data when building your model workflow. Some of the missing imputation classes are:\n\nSimpleImputer: for filling missing values using a simple rule like mean, median, most frequent value, and so on.\nKNNImputer: fills missing values using the values of nearest neighbors.\nIterativeImputer: fills missing values by modeling each feature with missing values as a function of the other features.\n\nExamples\n\nSimpleImputer:\nfrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Original data with missing values\ndata = np.array([[1, 2],\n                 [np.nan, 3],\n                 [7, np.nan]])\n\nprint(\"Original data:\")\nprint(pd.DataFrame(data, columns=[\"A\", \"B\"]))\n\n# Imputer replaces missing values with column mean\nimputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')\nimputed_data = imputer.fit_transform(data)\n\nprint(\"\\nImputed data (SimpleImputer - mean):\")\nprint(pd.DataFrame(imputed_data, columns=[\"A\", \"B\"]))\nOriginal data:\n     A    B\n0  1.0  2.0\n1  NaN  3.0\n2  7.0  NaN\n\nImputed data (SimpleImputer - mean):\n     A    B\n0  1.0  2.0\n1  4.0  3.0\n2  7.0  2.5\nThe above example shows mean imputation, which is mostly used for numerical variables, while the mode is used for categorical variables.\nKNNImputer:\nfrom sklearn.impute import KNNImputer\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndata = np.array([[1, 2],\n                 [np.nan, 3],\n                 [7, 6]])\n\nprint(\"Original data:\")\nprint(pd.DataFrame(data, columns=[\"A\", \"B\"]))\n\nimputer = KNNImputer(n_neighbors=2)\nimputed_data = imputer.fit_transform(data)\n\nprint(\"\\nImputed data (KNNImputer):\")\nprint(pd.DataFrame(imputed_data, columns=[\"A\", \"B\"]))\nOriginal data:\n     A    B\n0  1.0  2.0\n1  NaN  3.0\n2  7.0  6.0\n\nImputed data (KNNImputer):\n     A    B\n0  1.0  2.0\n1  4.0  3.0\n2  7.0  6.0\nIn the code above, the n_neighbors argument in the KNNImputer() class takes the number of nearest neighbors needed to run the missing data imputation.\nIterativeImputer:\nfrom sklearn.experimental import enable_iterative_imputer\nfrom sklearn.impute import IterativeImputer\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndata = np.array([[1, 2],\n                 [np.nan, 3],\n                 [7, np.nan]])\n\nprint(\"Original data:\")\nprint(pd.DataFrame(data, columns=[\"A\", \"B\"]))\n\nimputer = IterativeImputer(max_iter=10, random_state=0)\nimputed_data = imputer.fit_transform(data)\n\nprint(\"\\nImputed data (IterativeImputer):\")\nprint(pd.DataFrame(imputed_data, columns=[\"A\", \"B\"]))\nOriginal data:\n     A    B\n0  1.0  2.0\n1  NaN  3.0\n2  7.0  NaN\n\nImputed data (IterativeImputer):\n           A    B\n0   1.000000  2.0\n1  12.999998  3.0\n2   7.000000  2.5\n\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\n\n\n3. Fancyimpute\nFancyimpute is a standalone library for missing-data imputation that includes various algorithms. It also includes popular algorithms, which are already implemented in scikit-learn such as SimpleFill, KNN and IterativeImputer. Other complex algorithms in it are:\n\nSoftImpute: Which implements the Spectral Regularization Algorithms for Learning Large Incomplete Matrices for missing data imputation.\nIterativeSVD: Which implements the iterative low-rank SVD decomposition for imputing missing data.\nMatrixFactorization: This uses direct factorization to fill missing data.\nBiScaler: This uses iterative estimation of row/column means and standard deviations to get a doubly normalized matrix.\n\nExample\nHere is a simple example implementing the SoftImpute() class on missing data.\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom fancyimpute import SoftImpute\n\n# Sample data with missing values\ndata = np.array([\n    [5, 3, np.nan, 1],\n    [4, np.nan, np.nan, 1],\n    [1, 1, np.nan, 5],\n    [1, np.nan, np.nan, 4],\n    [np.nan, 1, 5, 4]\n])\n\nprint(\"Original data:\")\nprint(pd.DataFrame(data, columns=[\"Item1\", \"Item2\", \"Item3\", \"Item4\"]))\n\n# SoftImpute: matrix factorization-based imputation\nsoft_imputer = SoftImpute()\ndata_imputed = soft_imputer.fit_transform(data)\n\nprint(\"\\nImputed data (SoftImpute):\")\nprint(pd.DataFrame(data_imputed, columns=[\"Item1\", \"Item2\", \"Item3\", \"Item4\"]))\nOriginal data:\n   Item1  Item2  Item3  Item4\n0    5.0    3.0    NaN    1.0\n1    4.0    NaN    NaN    1.0\n2    1.0    1.0    NaN    5.0\n3    1.0    NaN    NaN    4.0\n4    NaN    1.0    5.0    4.0\n\nImputed data (SoftImpute):\n      Item1     Item2     Item3  Item4\n0  5.000000  3.000000  0.270492    1.0\n1  4.000000  2.270316  0.120304    1.0\n2  1.000000  1.000000  2.475254    5.0\n3  1.000000  0.896283  1.941855    4.0\n4  0.455978  1.000000  5.000000    4.0\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\n\n\n4. Missingno\nMissingno is a visualization library for missing observations that allows you to study the pattern of missing observations in your dataset. Through this visualization, you can understand why and how the observations in your data are missing. It’s easy to use and works seamlessly with Pandas. Missingno also supports visualizations such as matrix plot, bar plot, heatmap, and dendogram.\nExample\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport missingno as msno\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Sample dataset with missing values\ndata = pd.DataFrame({\n    'A': [1, 2, np.nan, 4, 5],\n    'B': [np.nan, 2, 3, np.nan, 5],\n    'C': [1, np.nan, np.nan, 4, 5],\n    'D': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n})\n\nprint(\"Original Data:\")\nprint(data)\n\n# Matrix plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(6,3))\nmsno.matrix(data)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nMissing data visualization with missingno. Image by Author.\n\n\nThe above example is a matrix plot of missing observations from the dataset. The matrix plot is like a visual display of the data, where the rows are the observations, while the columns are the variables. Shaded regions represent an observation with complete data, while the white regions represent missing data. The curve on the right shows the distribution of the rows with complete and incomplete data.\n\n\n5. MICEforest\nMICEforest is also a Python library for missing data imputation that uses Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations(MICE) through an iterative series of predictive models, based on other variables in the dataset. This method of imputation is better when you are handling complex missing observations in your data or missing data of mixed data types.\nExample\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport miceforest as mf\n\n# --- Create sample data ---\nnp.random.seed(42)\ndata = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Age': [25, 30, np.nan, 40, 22, np.nan, 35],\n    'Salary': [50000, 60000, 55000, np.nan, 52000, 58000, np.nan],\n    'Experience': [1, 3, 2, 5, np.nan, 4, np.nan]\n})\nprint(\"Original data with missing values:\")\nprint(data)\n\n# --- Create the imputation kernel ---\nkernel = mf.ImputationKernel(\n    data,\n    num_datasets=1,\n    random_state=42\n)\n\n# --- Run MICE for 3 iterations ---\nkernel.mice(3)\n\n# --- Get completed data ---\nimputed_data = kernel.complete_data(dataset=0)\nprint(\"\\nImputed data:\")\nprint(imputed_data)\nOriginal data with missing values:\n    Age   Salary  Experience\n0  25.0  50000.0         1.0\n1  30.0  60000.0         3.0\n2   NaN  55000.0         2.0\n3  40.0      NaN         5.0\n4  22.0  52000.0         NaN\n5   NaN  58000.0         4.0\n6  35.0      NaN         NaN\n\nImputed data:\n    Age   Salary  Experience\n0  25.0  50000.0         1.0\n1  30.0  60000.0         3.0\n2  40.0  55000.0         2.0\n3  40.0  50000.0         5.0\n4  22.0  52000.0         2.0\n5  35.0  58000.0         4.0\n6  35.0  55000.0         4.0\nFrom the code above, .ImputationKernel() creates a model that imputes each column by taking the number of imputed datasets as arguments, and also the random_state for reproducibility.\nThe .mice() method runs the iterations based on the number given, which is 3 in our case. It first of all imputes the missing values, then run another model based on the previous imputed data till the number of iterations is fulfilled.\n\n\n\nHow miceforest works.

Autoimpute\nAutoimpute is another Python library that supports a wide range of imputation methods such as univariate, multivariate, and interpolation methods. It works well with scikit-learn and scipy, and also supports missing data visualization using missingno.\nExample\n**import pandas as pd\nfrom autoimpute.imputations import SingleImputer\n\n# Example data\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    \"age\": [25, None, 30, 22, None],\n    \"salary\": [50000, 60000, None, None, 70000],\n    \"gender\": [\"M\", \"F\", \"F\", None, \"M\"]\n})\n\nimputer = SingleImputer(\n    strategy={\n        \"age\": \"mean\", \n        \"salary\": \"median\", \n        \"gender\": \"mode\"  # use mode instead of logistic regression\n    }\n)\n\ndf_imputed = imputer.fit_transform(df)\n\nprint(df)\nprint(df_imputed)**\n    age   salary gender\n0  25.0  50000.0      M\n1   NaN  60000.0      F\n2  30.0      NaN      F\n3  22.0      NaN   None\n4   NaN  70000.0      M\n         age   salary gender\n0  25.000000  50000.0      M\n1  25.666667  60000.0      F\n2  30.000000  60000.0      F\n3  22.000000  60000.0      F\n4  25.666667  70000.0      M\nThe above is a simple imputation using the SingleImputer class, where it imputes various rows with various measures of spread.\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\n\n\n7. H2O.ai\nPopularly known for it’s automl capabilities, H2O can also handle missing data observations both in static or streaming data. You can also use some of its methods to impute missing data, where it’s a simple imputation like mean, median, or mode, or advanced imputation techniques. H20 is also great in production. If you have incoming data that can contain missing values, you can use the H2O platform to handle that, ensuring that your ML model does not break and give wrong predictions in production.\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\n\n\n8. TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV)\nTensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV) is a powerful library designed to analyze, validate, and monitor data used in machine learning (ML) pipelines. It is useful in production environments, where data consistency and quality are critical for maintaining reliable model performance.\nTFDV allows you to detect issues such as missing features, data drift, and anomalies that may occur as new data flows into your production pipeline. If a particular observation or feature is missing, TFDV can flag it and help you decide whether to impute, correct, or exclude it based on your defined schema.\n\n\n\nimage.png\n\n\n\n\n9. Datawig (Amazon)\nDatawig is an open-source library developed by Amazon for data imputation. It offers advanced data imputation by learning from other variables. While offering complex missing data imputation, it’s easy to use and not verbose. It also handles both numerical and categorical missing data very well. Datawig uses various deep-learning-based imputation methods to fill missing data.\n\n\n\nimage.png"

    "text": "Best Practices for Missing Data Imputation\nWhen imputing missing data, here are some best practices you should adhere to:\n\nAlways visualize missingness patterns first: Visualizing missing data lets you see the nature of missing observations in your data. Through the visualizations, you can know the kind of missing data you are dealing with and the relationship of the missing data with other variables. This lets you know the kind of imputation technique to go for.\nAvoid blind imputation without domain knowledge: Don’t just drop missing data or impute data anyhow; try to understand why it’s missing. Some data have to be missing, for example, if in a survey given to both men and women, and there is a question regarding pregnancy or menstruation, it’s obvious that for males, those questions will contain missing values. This kind of missing value is understandable, and imputing it will mean the male has been pregnant or menstruating, which is not possible.\nCompare multiple methods for robustness: Test various imputation methods; some imputation methods are more robust than others. Also, it’s advisable that you go for multiple imputations to get accurate results.\nValidate imputation impact on model performance: If possible, try to run your model with and without missing values imputed, which lets you see the impact of the missing values on the model and if they are worth imputing."

    "text": "What is JWT?\nJWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe way of representing claims between two parties, typically used for secure authentication and data exchange. It consists of three parts:\n\nHeader: Specifying the token type and hashing algorithm\nPayload: Containing the claims (like user ID or roles)\nSignature: Used to verify the token’s integrity and authenticity. Once issued, a JWT can be sent with each client request (often in the HTTP header) so the server can validate the user without querying the database every time.\n\nWhen you log into a website like Amazon, the server verifies your credentials and responds with a JWT. This token is stored in your browser (e.g., in local storage). On each subsequent request—like adding an item to your cart—the JWT is sent along, proving your identity without logging in again, until it expires.\n\n\n\nHow JWT works. Image by Author"

The salt is a random value added to make the hash harder to guess. If none is provided, the function creates a new one.\nThe hash_password function uses HMAC with SHA-256 to hash the password + salt securely, and returns both the hash and the salt so we can verify the password later.\n# Verify a password against a stored hash\ndef verify_password(stored_password, provided_password):\n    hash_obj = hmac.new(stored_password[\"salt\"], provided_password.encode('utf-8'), hashlib.sha256).digest()\n    return hash_obj == stored_password[\"hash\"]\nThe verify_passwordfunction checks if the password someone types in matches the stored hashed one.

The function retrieves the entered email and password, then performs basic validation: if either field is empty, it shows an error message prompting the user to fill both. If the email doesn’t exist in the USERS dictionary or the password verification via verify_password()fails, it returns a generic \"Invalid email or password\" message.\nIf both credentials are valid, it generates a JWT token using generate_token() and stores it in token_value, effectively logging in the user.

It checks if a JWT token exists in token_value, verifies it using verify_token(), and if valid, returns a greeting using the user’s name from the token’s payload. If the token is absent or invalid, it returns an empty string.\nThe second part is a reactive logout handler defined with @reactive.effect and triggered by the input.logout_btn event. When the logout button is clicked, this function runs and clears the JWT token by setting token_value to None, effectively logging the user out and reverting the UI to an unauthenticated state.\nTo make the application runnable, add the following line of code at the end of app.py.\napp = App(app_ui, server)"

You can specify various numbers of jobs, here we only have one job named build.\nruns-on: ubuntu-latest means that the job should run on the latest version of Ubuntu, which is the environment in which the code is tested.\nuses: actions/checkout@v3, the first step, clones your code onto the virtual machine where the test will run.\nThe next step, which is name: Set up Python, installs Python on the virtual machine, specifically version 3.12.1, to ensure the code runs in the correct Python environment.\nThe next step name: Install dependencies and lint, install the project dependencies, and check for linting.\n\npython -m pip install --upgrade pip upgrades pip.\npip install -r requirements.txt installs the required libraries.\npip install ruff installs Ruff, a tool that checks your code for potential errors and enforces linting.\nruff --format=github --target-version=py310 . || true runs Ruff to analyze your code. If Ruff detects an issue, ||true ensures that the workflow continues running, allowing you to see listing results without stopping the testing process.\n\nThe last step name: Test with pytest runs the unit tests and checks how much code was covered by the tests.\n\n\nStep 2 - Push to GitHub to run the workflow\nPush your project to GitHub to run the workflow, then go to the Actions tab under the project repository.

Image by Author.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3 - Create a branch to make a merge request.\nLet’s create a branch and break some code functionality to ensure the test fails. Create a new branch, change any numbers used in the test function of the test_main.py file, and push to GitHub under the new branch.\n\n\n\nDifference between the main and new branch.

If you make a pull request, you will see that all tests have been successfully passed.\n\n\n\nAll checks were successfully passed. Image by Author.\n\n\nCollaborators can still make merge requests even if the tests fail. You need to enforce a rule that prevents any pull request from merging if all tests have not been passed. Go to the GitHub settings and select branch. Under the branch section, give a name to the rule you are about to set and check the option Require status checks to pass.\n\n\n\nGo to Branch rules to enforce a rule. Image by Author."

Time series data is applied in various fields, from forecasting mortality rates in healthcare to fraud detection in finance and pattern recognition.\n\nKey features of time series data\nBefore calling data, a time series data must have some features. Here is an outline of these features.\n\nChronological Order: Observations are ordered in time.\nTime Dependency: The current value in the series depends on past values.\nStationarity: The mean and variance are constant over time, indicating a consistent pattern.\nTrend: Long-term upward or downward movement.\nSeasonality: Regular and repeating patterns over specific intervals.\nNoise: Random variation or irregular patterns."

    "text": "What is a Forest plot?\nA forest plot is a type of graph used in research to show the results of a single topic from multiple studies line by line. Each study is represented by a line and a dot, where the dot shows the main result (how effective a treatment is) while the line shows the range of possible results, also known as the confidence intervals. The forest plot sometimes includes a diamond-shaped plot below, summarizing all the results of the studies. If all the lines are close to each other, then it means the studies agree on that particular topic or there are varying findings on that topic.\n\nComponents of a Forest plot\n\nStudy Labels: Located at the left side of the plot, these labels identify each respective study and contain the study author and year.\nEffect Size: This represents the observed effect of an outcome in each study, such as the prevalence of a disease. The position of the point on the plot indicates whether the effect is negative, neutral, or positive.\nConfidence Intervals: Each study shows a horizontal line showing the range of possible outcomes. The narrower the line, the higher the precision of the effect Size.\nNo Effect Line: This vertical line is either zero or one, representing no effect. If a study confidence interval crosses this line, the study is not statistically significant.\nOverall Effect (Diamond Shape): This represents the pooled effect from all studies at the plot’s bottom. The center of the diamond shows the overall effect, while the width of the diamond represents the confidence interval. The combined result is statistically significant if the diamond does not cross the no-effect line.\n\n\n\n\nForest Plot. Image by Author"

The horizontal lines around each square represent the range of values (“confidence interval”) within which we expect the actual effect size to fall 95% of the time. If this line crosses 1, the effect could be neutral (neither positive nor negative).\nSome studies, like (Smith et al. 2015) and (Brown et al. 2017), have effect sizes above 1, and their confidence intervals do not cross 1.

The wider the band, the less confident the model is.\n\nThe graph shows a clear upward trend starting in 2023, which Prophet successfully captured. There are also weekly fluctuations, which are the tiny ripples in the blue line; this reflects weekly cycles. The model is reasonably confident in the short term, but a significant spread indicates variability in the underlying data.\nLet’s break the model into components such as trend and seasonality.\nfig2 = model.plot_components(forecast)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nForecast decomposition. Image by Author.\n\n\nThe first plot, which shows the trend, shows that the channel’s YouTube presence significantly grew in 2022, and Prophet recognizes that upward shift as a long-term trend.\nThe second plot, which shows the weekly seasonality, shows that people are less engaged on weekends, especially Saturdays. This means the channel should avoid uploads on Saturdays and focus more on midweek to Thursday when there is peak traffic.\nThe last plot, the yearly seasonality, shows that the viewership peaks at the start of the year, again around September, and in late fall. There are slumps during the summer, likely due to vacations, less screen time, and holiday weeks like December."

    "text": "You are building a shiny application that processes and visualizes financial data, and a calculation function within the app for calculating financial ratios is incorrect; this could lead to misleading results and poor user decision-making. Unit tests allow you, the developer, to isolate and validate these functions independently, catch errors early, and ensure that changes in other application parts do not unintentionally break a function’s functionality.\nUnit testing, also known as module or component testing, is the process of testing smaller components of an application to ensure they work as expected. Because unit tests are applied to various components and modules, they make it easy to identify and fix bugs in an application. They are also easy to write and don’t require any input or output from your application for you to run them. In this article, you will learn about unit tests and how you can effectively implement unit tests in your Python Shiny applications."

You can solve this problem by writing good unit tests for your application, and you need to separate concerns to achieve that. That is why, in Python Shiny applications, it’s important to separate business logic from reactive logic to ensure that the application is maintainable and scalable in the long run.\nFor example, look at the financial application you are building; the business logic is the computations and data processing of the app’s user interface, such as data validation, financial calculations, and error handling. The reactive logic is user inputs and reactive outputs, such as file uploads and selecting the financial ratio to compute, display of calculated ratios, generating and updating graphs, etc. Separating the business logic from reactive logic ensures:\n\nAccuracy and Reliability: By separating the business logic from reactive logic. You can rigorously test the business logic to ensure the calculations are correct.\nMaintainability: In the future, you can change business logic without affecting the reactive logic and breaking the user interface.\nTestability: Isolating each calculation in the business logic ensures that every function is tested independently and its value is computed before it is used in the Shiny environment.\nReusability: One might want to use the business logic in one or more contexts or applications; this reduces redundancy and enhances code efficiency."

First, ensure you have installed Shiny and Pytest.\npip install shiny pytest\nPaste the following code into a file utilis.py.\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Business Logic\ndef fetch_data():\n    data = pd.read_csv(\"supermarket_sales.csv\")\n    return data\n\ndef total_profit(data):\n    profit = sum(data[\"gross income\"])\n    return profit\n\ndef total_revenue(data):\n    revenue = sum(data[\"cogs\"])\n    return revenue\nThis is our business logic for the Python Shiny application. To keep it simple, let’s restrict it to three functions.\n\nfetch_data() to load the sales data.\ntotal_profit() to calculate the total profit.\ntotal_revenue() to calculate the total revenue.\n\nNext, let’s build the application’s user interface. Copy and paste the following code into a separate file, main.py.\nfrom shiny import reactive\n\nfrom shiny.express import input, render, ui\n\nfrom utilis import fetch_data, total_profit, total_revenue\n\nwith ui.card():\n    ui.h2(\"Sales Dashboard\"),\n    ui.input_select(\n        \"calculation\", \"Select calculation:\", choices=[\"Total Profit\", \"Total Revenue\"]\n    )\n    ui.input_action_button(\"compute\", \"Compute!\")\n\nwith ui.card():\n    with ui.h1():\n        @render.text\n        @reactive.event(input.compute)\n        def result():\n            if input.calculation() == \"Total Profit\":\n                value = total_profit(fetch_data())\n            else:\n                value = total_revenue(fetch_data())\n\n            return value\nRun this using the command.\nshiny run --reload main.py\n\n\n\nLive Application. Image by Author\n\n\nIf you are building a toy project, you could deploy the application straightaway, but in production, you need to test for each and every component, especially your business logic. If you run the tests in the future and it fails, the unit test will help you track which function has a bug.\n\nUsing Pytest with Shiny\nWhen writing tests with Pytest, your test files must start with either the prefix test_ prefix or end with the suffix_test. This ensures that Pytest identifies the files and functions to run the unit tests.\nCopy and paste the following into a file,\ntest_main.py.\nfrom utilis import fetch_data, total_profit, total_revenue\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Business Logic\ndata = fetch_data()\n\ndef test_total_profit():\n    assert total_profit(data) == 15379.369\n\ndef test_total_revenue():\n    assert total_revenue(data) == 307587.38\n\nFirst of all, we have to import the data that loads the dataset and store it in the variable data\nThe test_total_profit() function tests if the total_profit function is giving the correct profit sum.\nThe same applies to the test_total_revenue() function, which must be checked to ensure that it returns the correct revenue sum.\n\nTo run the test, call pytest on your terminal.\npytest \n\n\n\nTwo unit tests successfully passed. Image by Author.\n\n\nChange the test_total_profit value in the test function to 16000 and run the test again.\ndef test_total_profit():\n    assert total_profit(data) == 16000\n\n\n\nOne successful test passed, and one failed . Image by Author.\n\n\nYou will notice that not only did the test fail, but it also pointed out the function where it failed. This is very handy when your application has many functions.\nNow, revert the test_total_profit()to its original value, change the name to total_test_profit(), and run the test.\n\n\n\nOne unit test ran and passed. Image by Author.\n\n\nYou can see that only one of the tests ran, and this is due to the absence of the test_ prefix or _test suffix."

This will make it difficult to pinpoint issues when a test fails. Always make sure each of your test functions has a single assertion.\nMaintain Independence: Make sure your test functions are not reliant on the outcome of other test functions.\nDocumentation: Document your tests to make them easier to maintain and update in the future. This will be handy for you or others who want to work on the project.\nCI Integration: You will notice earlier that we ran the test manually on the terminal; you can use continuous integration systems like GitHub Actions to automate the test periodically and even send alerts when something goes wrong.\nMaintenance: Don’t just write a test and forget about it. Regularly revisit the test and update it as you update your application codebase.\nSimplicity: Keep your test functions simple, so each test should test for a function in your application.\nProper Naming Conventions: Adopt proper and descriptive naming conventions. Naming your test functions right will avoid overcrowding your test files with comments.\nPay Attention to Code Coverage: High code coverage reduces the chances of having bugs in your application. When writing your test function, always account for every possible condition and error you might expect."

    "section": "What are Parametric Statistics",
    "text": "What are Parametric Statistics\nParametric statistics is a branch of statistics that assumes the data follows an underlying population distribution, usually the normal distribution.\nIt uses parameters such as the mean, standard deviation, variance, and correlation, among others, to make inferences about the population.\n\nKey assumptions\nThese are the assumptions your data have to meet for you to use parametric statistics:\n\nNormality: The data should be approximately normally distributed. When the density plot is plotted, it should have a bell-shaped curve.\nEqual Variance: Parametric statistics expect the data to have equal variances. For example, if you want to compare men’s vs women’s reaction times with a t-test, both groups should have a similar spread in reaction times.\nIndependence of Observations: Each observation should not depend on another observation. For example, in a drug trial, one patient’s response should not affect another patient’s response.\nScale of Measurement: The data used should be on a quantitative scale, either interval or ratio. You can’t use parametric statistics for data that are categorical in nature.\nRandom Sampling: Data is obtained from a random sample of a population to ensure the results can be generalized. If you want to know the average blood pressure in a city, you shouldn’t just pick the patients from one clinic, but pick randomly from different clinics across the city.\n\n\n\n\nNormal distribution. Source: Image generated by Nano Banana.\n\n\n\n\nExamples\nThere are various examples of parametric tests, some of which are:\n\nt-test: Also known as the Student t-test, is used when you are interested in comparing two groups. For example, a pharmaceutical company who are interested in knowing if a new painkiller works better than the standard one.\nANOVA: The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is used to compare three or more groups. For example, a teacher wants to compare four different teaching methods and see if they lead to the same exam score.\nPearson Correlation: This is one of the various types of correlation in statistics, used to test the strength and relationship between two variables. For example, a researcher wants to test the relationship between income and education.\nZ-test: Mostly used in quality control to see if the sample mean equals the population mean. For example, a manufacturing company interested in determining if light bulbs are supposed to last 1,000 hours on average, randomly tests 50 bulbs and compares the sample mean to 1,000 hours.\n\n\n\n\nApplication of Z-test in lilght bulb manufacturing. Source: Image generated by Nano Banana.\n\n\n\n\nAdvantages\nParametric statistics are widely used in research due to the advantages they offer, some of which are:\n\nMore Statistical Power: They tend to detect a real effect if it exists. A medical researcher using a t-test to check if a new drug lowers blood pressure will have a better chance of detecting a real improvement by using parametric statistics.\nAbility to Estimate Parameters: They provide estimates of population characteristics like mean, variance, and standard deviation. A factory doesn’t just want to know if bulbs differ; it also wants to know the average lifespan and the spread, which is one of the use cases of parametric statistics.\nWider Range of Tests Available: There are a lot of parametric tests covering both simple and complex scenarios, giving researchers many tools to work with and compare.\nFlexibility and Efficiency with Large Samples: With larger datasets, parametric methods handle data efficiently, and assumptions are less strict due to the central limit theorem.\nResults are Easier to Interpret: The outputs of parametric tests are intuitive and directly tied to real-world quantities."

    "text": "What are Non-Parametric Statistics?\nUnlike parametric statistics, non-parametric statistics do not rely on assumptions about the population distribution. They do not require the data to follow a normal distribution.\nInstead of estimating parameters like means and variances, non-parametric statistics rely on medians, ranks, or counts.\nThey come in handy when the data is skewed, categorical, or has a small sample size\n\n\n\nNormal vs Skewed data. Source: Image generated by Nano Banana.\n\n\nImage generated by Nano Banana.\n\nKey assumptions\nHere is what your data needs to have for applying non-parametric statistics.\n\nIndependence of Observations: Just like parametric statistics, non-parametric statistics also expect the observations to be independent of each other.\nAppropriate Measurement Scale: Non-parametric statistics can handle data that is on either an interval, ratio, or ordinal scale.\nRandom Sampling: Non-parametric statistics expect the data to come randomly from a population, just like parametric statistics.\n\n\n\nExamples\nMost of the tests under parametric statistics have their non-parametric alternatives, in case the data you want to apply it to violates any of the parametric assumptions.\n\nMann-Whitney U Test: This is an alternative to the independent t-test, and is used to compare two groups when the data is not normally distributed. For example, comparing the customer satisfaction ratings between two restaurants.\nWilcoxon Signed-Rank Test: A non-parametric alternative to the paired t-test that compares two related samples. For example, measuring stress levels before and after yoga sessions, if the data is skewed.\nKruskal-Wallis Test: Non-parametric alternative to the ANOVA for comparing three or more groups without assuming normality. An example is comparing median waiting times across three banks.\nSpearman’s Rank Correlation: Measures association based on ranks and not raw values. It’s an alternative to Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient.\nChi-Square Test: It is used to test the relationship between two categorical variables. For example, testing if gender is related to preferred smartphone brand.\n\n\n\nAdvantages\n\nFewer Assumptions: Non-parametric statistics are suitable when the data is not normal, skewed, or ordinal. Customer satisfaction surveys often use ranks or ratings, which are perfect for non-parametric statistics.\nSuitable for Small Samples: When you don’t have sufficient data to check for normality, you can use the non-parametric tests to analyze your data.\nNot Affected by Outliers: Means are sensitive to outliers, which makes any data with outliers not a good fit for parametric statistics. Non-parametric statistics use the median because they are more robust. For example, income data where a few billionaires distort the mean is better analyzed with medians.\nWork with different data types: You can use non-parametric statistics to analyze different types of data, such as interval, ratio, and ordinal."

Still, due to machine learning models requiring regular updates to improve model accuracy and use in other applications, they are exposed as an API. An ML API is an application that serves as a gateway between your client requests or needs and your machine learning model.\nLet’s say you have a recommender model on an e-library platform, that recommends books for users based on user preferences. This recommender model works as an API by getting user preferences and recommending books to the user. The API also makes it easy for you to use the recommender model on another platform.\nDue to the sensitivity of training data in machine learning models, API security is important to avoid data breaches and prevent malicious clients from accessing the model. In this article, I will show you how to secure your machine-learning APIs using FastAPI - an open-source Python framework that allows you to build secured and scalable APIs. As a Python library, the learning curve is low for data scientists and machine learning engineers with Python backgrounds.

    "section": "Implementing Authentication and Authorization",
    "text": "Implementing Authentication and Authorization\nTake API authentication like a passkey that allows a client to access your API, allowing only authorized users to use the API. There are various ways of implementing API authentication in FastAPI, which you will learn subsequently.\n\n\n\nAuthentication vs Authorization. Source: Medium\n\n\nAPI authentication is insufficient to protect your API, you also need to implement API authorization. API authentication is like giving someone a key to your house, while API authorization is like giving them access to specific rooms in the house.\n\nAPI Key-Based Authentication\nThis is the most basic and popular form of implementing API security.\n\nTo implement key-based authentication in FastAPI, add the following code before the @app.post(\"/predict\") endpoint in main.py file.\n# Define the API key\nAPI_KEY = \"your_api_key_here\"\n\n# Dependency to verify the API key\ndef get_api_key(api_key: str = Header(...)):\n    if api_key != API_KEY:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail=\"Could not validate credentials\")\n\nAPI_KEY is the variable that contains your environment key, which is supposed to be stored as an environment variable in a .env file.\nget_api_key() function gets the API_KEY and verifies if the provided API key matches what’s on the database. If successful, the user is granted access to the API, else an HTTP error 403 is raised, telling the user that the provided credential is invalid.\n\nNext, go to the predict() function and add api_key as an argument to get the api_key from users.\n@app.post(\"/predict\")\ndef predict(request: PredictionRequest, \n                        #added argument to get API key from user\n            api_key: str = Depends(get_api_key)):\n\nDepends function prevents access to the /predict endpoint without the API key.\n\n\n\n\nHow authentication works in FastAPI\n\n\n\n\n\nOAuth2 with JWT Tokens\nUnlike API keys, OAuth2 is an authorization protocol, granting clients access to resources hosted by other web applications on behalf of the user. With OAuth2, users do not need to give out their password to access a resource.\nA practical example is a client accessing your machine learning API using their Google ID without giving away their details, and your API in turn sends a token back to the client to serve as a temporary password for the client to access the API. It’s very secure compared to the API key. Unlike the API key which grants a user access to all resources in an API, OAuth2 only grants the client access to specified resources.\nWhen a user wants to access a machine learning API through a client application, the process typically uses OAuth2 for secure authentication. The client application starts by redirecting the user to an authentication server, where the user grants permission for the application to access their resources. The authentication server then issues an access token, often, in the form of a JWT (JSON Web Token) to the client application. The application uses this token to make requests to the machine learning API. The API verifies the token to ensure the client is authorized to access the requested resources, thus providing secure and controlled access while protecting user data and privacy.\n\n\n\nOAuth2 Workflow: Source: GeeksforGeeks\n\n\nLet’s implement a simple OAuth2 with JWT on our machine learning API, by updating the main.py file as follows.\n\nEnsure you install pyjwt and import the following Python libraries.\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException\nfrom fastapi.security import OAuth2PasswordBearer, OAuth2PasswordRequestForm\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nimport joblib\nfrom typing import Optional\nimport jwt\n\nOAuth2PasswordBearer and OAuth2PasswordRequestForm are used to implement OAuth2 in FastAPI.\njwt is used to create a JSON Web Token.\n\nDefine the user model, to allow the user to provide a username and password using the BaseModel class.\n# Define a user model\nclass User(BaseModel):\n    username: str\n    password: str\nCreate a function to authenticate users.\ndef authenticate_user(username: str, password: str) -&gt; Optional[User]:\n    if username == \"admin\" and password == \"password\":\n        return User(username=username, password=password)\n    return None\n\nThe authenticate_user() function takes in a client username and password to see if it matches what’s in the database and returns a User model.\n\nCreate a SECRET_KEY variable to encode the JWT and create an oauth2_scheme\nSECRET_KEY = \"your-secret-key\"\n\n# OAuth2 scheme using password flow\noauth2_scheme = OAuth2PasswordBearer(tokenUrl=\"token\")\nCreate a function to access the token using JWT.\ndef create_access_token(data: dict):\n    return jwt.encode(data, SECRET_KEY)\n\nThe create_access_token() function takes in the user details and encodes it with the SECRET_KEY\n\nCreate an authentication route to generate the access token.\n@app.post(\"/token\")\nasync def login_for_access_token(form_data: OAuth2PasswordRequestForm = Depends()):\n    user = authenticate_user(form_data.username, form_data.password)\n    if not user:\n        raise HTTPException(\n            status_code=401,\n            detail=\"Incorrect username or password\",\n            headers={\"WWW-Authenticate\": \"Bearer\"},\n        )\n    access_token = create_access_token({\"sub\": user.username})\n    return {\"access_token\": access_token, \"token_type\": \"bearer\"}\n\nThe login_for_access_token()function takes the user inputs; username and password with the OAuth2 flow as an argument to return an access token to give the client application.\nIf user details are right, an access token is created and returned, else a 401 warning is returned\n\nProtect the API route that requires JWT authentication\n@app.post(\"/predict\")\nasync def predict(request: PredictionRequest, token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme)):\n    try:\n        # Decode JWT token\n        payload = jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=[\"HS256\"])\n        # Convert request data to a format suitable for the model\n        data = [\n            [\n                request.sepal_length,\n                request.sepal_width,\n                request.petal_length,\n                request.petal_width,\n            ]\n        ]\n        # Make a prediction\n        prediction = model.predict(data)\n        # Return the prediction as a response\n        return {\"prediction\": int(prediction[0])}\n    except jwt.exceptions.DecodeError:\n        raise HTTPException(\n            status_code=401,\n            detail=\"Could not validate credentials\",\n            headers={\"WWW-Authenticate\": \"Bearer\"},\n        )\n\nThe argument token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme) means the API endpoint is protected using OAuth2, and receives the access token from the client application.\nThe token is decoded to see if it contains the SECRET_KEY, if it does, access is given to the model prediction, else a warning is given stating that the provided credentials are invalid.\n\n\n\n\nKey takeaways\n\nUser logs in and their data is encoded with a secret key to create an access token\nThe secured API endpoint decodes this access token to see if it contains the secret key before providing access to the resource.\n\n\n\nHow OAuth2 works in FastAPI.\n\n\nHow OAuth2 works in FastAPI.\n\n\n\nRole-Based Access Control (RBAC)\nRBAC is an approach where users are given various roles that provide access to specific API resources. It is an efficient way of ensuring API security, instead of granting all users privileges, users are granted privileges based on their needs in an API.\n\nLet’s implement an RBAC into the OAuth we created recently, by creating a dummy user data inside main.py.\n# Dummy user data\nusers_db = {\n    \"admin\": {\"username\": \"admin\", \"password\": \"password\", \"role\": \"admin\"},\n    \"user\": {\"username\": \"user\", \"password\": \"password\", \"role\": \"user\"}\n}\nTo demonstrate RBAC, admin will have access to our model prediction API endpoint while user will not have access to it. Update the User model to have a role field.\n# Define a user model with role\nclass User(BaseModel):\n    username: str\n    password: str\n    role: str\nJust before the API endpoint, add the following function\n# Role-based access control dependency\ndef role_checker(required_role: str):\n    def role_dependency(current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)):\n        if current_user.role != required_role:\n            raise HTTPException(\n                status_code=403,\n                detail=\"Operation not permitted\",\n            )\n        return current_user\n    return role_dependency\n\nThe function role_checker() checks for the required role, by taking the required role admin as an argument.\nThe role_dependency() function checks if a user meets a required role, by taking the User as an argument.\nIf the user meets the required role, then the user is granted access, else a 403 status code is returned with a warning \"Operation not permitted\"\n\nUpdate the API endpoint by adding a user argument.\n@app.post(\"/predict\")\nasync def predict(request: PredictionRequest, \n                  token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme), \n                  current_user: User = Depends(role_checker(\"admin\"))):\n\nThe current_user argument ensures that no User can access an API endpoint unless given permission.\n\n\n\nHow RBAC works in FastAPI."

Copy and paste the following code into your terminal.\nopenssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes\nThis will generate a self-signed SSL/TLS certificate with a private key using OpenSSL.\n\nopenssl: This is the command-line tool for using the various cryptography functions of OpenSSL’s library.\nreq: This sub-command is used to create and process certificate requests (CSRs) and, in this case, to create a self-signed certificate.\nx509: This option is used to generate a self-signed certificate instead of a certificate request.\nnewkey rsa:4096: This option does two things:\n\nnewkey: It generates a new private key along with the certificate.\nrsa:4096: This specifies the type of key to create, in this case, an RSA key with a size of 4096 bits.\n\nkeyout key.pem: This specifies the file where the newly generated private key will be saved (key.pem).\nout cert.pem: This specifies the file where the self-signed certificate will be saved (cert.pem).\ndays 365: This sets the certificate to be valid for 365 days (1 year).\nnodes: This option ensures that the private key will not be encrypted with a passphrase. Without this option, OpenSSL would prompt for a passphrase to encrypt the private key.\n\nProvide the necessary information to create the key.pem (private key) and cert.pem (certificate).\n\n\n\nGenerating a self-signed certificate using OpenSSL.\n\n\nGenerating a self-signed certificate using OpenSSL.\nAt the end of the main.py file, add the following code.\nimport uvicorn \n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    uvicorn.run(\n        app, host=\"127.0.0.1\", port=8000, ssl_keyfile=\"key.pem\", ssl_certfile=\"cert.pem\"\n    )\nuvicorn.run ensures your application runs on HTTPS using the generated key.pem and cert.pem.\nYou can now run the API using the following code on your terminal\npython main.py\n\n\n\nURL to the Model API displayed on terminal\n\n\nIn a production environment, it is recommended to use a reverse proxy server like Nginx to handle SSL termination and forwarded requests to the FastAPI application, to ensure better performance and security.\n\n\n\nEncrypting Sensitive Data\nEncryption is simply the encoding of sensitive information, such that even if the information were to leak, the content is secured and remains unknown, upon reaching its target destination the data is decoded. This is very useful in protecting sensitive data such as passwords, and only authorized users can decrypt the information using a decryption key. Here is a simple example of how encryption works.\n\nImport all necessary libraries and create an instance of the FastAPI class.\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Depends\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nfrom cryptography.fernet import Fernet\n\napp = FastAPI()\nNext is to generate key for encryption and decryption using the Fernet class.\n# Generate a key for encryption and decryption\nkey = Fernet.generate_key()\ncipher_suite = Fernet(key)\nCreate an Item model for receiving a text, and the EncryptedItem model for receiving the encrypted text.\n# Models\nclass Item(BaseModel):\n    plaintext: str\n\nclass EncryptedItem(BaseModel):\n    ciphertext: str\nCreate the encryption endpoint.\n@app.post(\"/encrypt/\", response_model=EncryptedItem)\nasync def encrypt_item(item: Item):\n    plaintext = item.plaintext.encode(\"utf-8\")\n    ciphertext = cipher_suite.encrypt(plaintext)\n    return {\"ciphertext\": ciphertext.decode(\"utf-8\")}\nThis takes the given item and encodes it to utf-8 , the cipher_suite key encrypts the plaintext to ciphertext which is a string of gibberish characters.\nCreate the decryption endpoint that decrypts the gibberish characters to the plaintext.\n# Decryption endpoint\n@app.post(\"/decrypt/\", response_model=Item)\nasync def decrypt_item(encrypted_item: EncryptedItem):\n    ciphertext = encrypted_item.ciphertext.encode(\"utf-8\")\n    try:\n        plaintext = cipher_suite.decrypt(ciphertext)\n        return {\"plaintext\": plaintext.decode(\"utf-8\")}\n    except Exception as e:\n        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail=\"Decryption failed\")\nThis endpoint takes the encrypted_item and encodes it to utf-8 before decrypting it to plaintext using the cipher_suite function. If the wrong ciphertext is provided, a 400 status code is returned with the detail \"Decryption failed\".\n\n\n\nEncrypting sensitive data in FastAPI\n\n\n\n\n\nRate Limiting and Throttling\nAnother way of securing APIs is by limiting the number of API calls made to the server. This is where rate limiting and throttling comes into play. Rate limiting is a technique of controlling the amount of incoming and outgoing traffic to or from a network, to prevent abuse and overloading of the server. While throttling on the other hand is temporarily slowing down the rate at which the API processes requests. To apply rate limiting and throttling to our previous example.\n\nEnsure you have installed the slowapi library, a library for implementing rate-limiting and throttling to APIs, and add the following new imports.\nfrom slowapi import Limiter, _rate_limit_exceeded_handler\nfrom slowapi.util import get_remote_address\nfrom slowapi.errors import RateLimitExceeded\nNext is to initialize the rate limiter.\nlimiter = Limiter(key_func=get_remote_address)\napp = FastAPI()\napp.state.limiter = limiter\napp.add_exception_handler(RateLimitExceeded, _rate_limit_exceeded_handler)\nApply the rate limiter to the /token/ endpoint using @limiter.limit(\"5/minute\") decorator, and the request: Request parameter in the login_for_access_token function.\n@app.post(\"/token\")\n@limiter.limit(\"5/minute\")\nasync def login_for_access_token(request: Request, form_data: OAuth2PasswordRequestForm = Depends()):\nAlso, apply a 10-minute rate limiting to the /predict endpoint. Change the parameter name in the predict function from request to prediction_request to avoid confusion with the new request: Request parameter.\n@app.post(\"/predict\")\n@limiter.limit(\"10/minute\")\nasync def predict(\n    request: Request,\n    prediction_request: PredictionRequest,\n    token: str = Depends(oauth2_scheme),\n    current_user: User = Depends(role_checker(\"admin\"))"

It provides an interactive graphical user interface, making it easy for non-technical users to start developing.\nLow-code tools help developers quickly get started, writing little or no code. It helps professional developers quickly deliver applications, letting them focus on the business side of the applications. Some features of low-code tools are:\n\nIt offers an interactive user interface with high-level functions, eliminating the need to write complex code.\nIt is easy to modify or adapt.\nMostly developed for a specific use case or audience\nIt is easy to scale.\n\nNo-code, on the other hand, is a method of developing applications that allows non-technical business users; business analysts, admin officers, small business owners, and others, to build applications without the need to write a single line of code. Some features of no-code tools are:\n\nPurely visual development, that is, users develop using drag-and-drop interfaces.\nIt offers limited customization, users use what is provided in the tool and can’t extend its capabilities.\nSuited for non-technical individuals\nMostly suited for simple use cases\n\nLow-code tools require some basic coding skills, unlike no-code which does not require any programming knowledge. Low-code/no-code is based on visual programming and automatic code generation. The emergence of low-code/no-code was the fact that domain experts know how difficult it is to impart to the IT team, with the help of low-code/no-code, they can take part in the development process, coupled with the fact that the shortage of skilled developers and loads of workload on the IT professionals is another reason for the emergence of low-code/no-code."

    "section": "Understanding the ELT Process",
    "text": "Understanding the ELT Process\nELT stands for Extract, Load and Transform, which are the three stages involved in the process.\nIt’s a data preprocessing technique that involves moving raw data from a source to a data storage area, either a data lake or a data warehouse. Sources are either social media platforms, streaming platforms or any other place data is stored. During extraction, data is copied in raw form from the source location to a staging area, this is either in a structured or unstructured format from sources such as:\n\nSQL or NoSQL servers\nText and document files\nEmail\nWeb pages\n\nExtraction is either full which involves pulling all rows and columns from a particular data source, using an automated partial extraction with update notifications when data is added to the system, or incremental where update records are extracted as data is added into the data source.\nLoading involves moving the data from the staging area to the data storage area, either a data lake or a data warehouse. This process is automated, continuous and done in batch. One can load all the available data in the data source to the data storage area, load modified data from the source between certain intervals or load data into the storage area in real time.\nIn the transform stage, a pre-written schema is run on the data using SQL for analysis. This stage involves filtering, removing duplications, currency conversions, removal of encryptions, joining data into tables or performing calculations.\nUnlike in ETL where raw data is transformed before being loaded into a destination source, in ELT the data is loaded into a destination source before it’s transformed for analysis as needed.\n\nBy allowing transformation to occur after loading, data is moved quickly to the destination for availability. Because data is transformed after arrival at the destination, ELT allows the data recipient to control data manipulation. This ensures that coding errors when transforming do not affect another stage. ELT uses the powerful big data warehouse and lakes allowing transformation and scalable computation.\nData warehouses use MPP architecture (Massively Parallel Processing), and data lake processes also support the application of schema or transformation models as soon as the data is received, this makes the process flexible, especially for large amounts of data. ELT is suited for data that are in cloud environments, this provides a seamless integration since ELT is cloud-native and allows for the continuous flow of data from sources to storage destinations, hence making them on demand.\nELT is used for instant access to huge volumes of data, for example in IOT, it loads data from IOT devices making it readily available for data scientists or analysts to access raw data and work collaboratively.\nDespite its advantages, ELT has some of its limitations:\n\nData privacy is a challenge in ELT, this is because when transferring data, a breach can occur from the source to the destination storage which poses security and privacy risks.\nWhile in transit, if care is not taken sensitive information is exposed, and extra security measures have to be taken to ensure the confidentiality of the data.\nELT handle large volumes of data, making it computationally intensive, leading to delays in gaining insights.\nBecause the data is loaded into the data storage area without transformation, it makes it challenging to transform the data when compared with ETL. This requires strong technical and domain knowledge of the data scientist and analyst who will write the queries transforming the data."

Here are some of the benefits of using low-code/no-code ELT tools:\n\nIt is easier compared to writing scripts to automate the ELT process.\nIt makes development faster, developers can spend more time solving business problems instead of fixing bugs that result from writing lines of code.\nIt increases automation, a lot of processes that would have to be set up manually are handled automatically, such as monitoring, logging, setting notifications when there is a problem with the pipeline and so on.\nMost ELT tools support a lot of data connectors, making it easy for an organization to connect to any data source with provisions to create custom connectors.\nELT tools lower the cost of building an ELT pipeline by ensuring the whole process is conducted with a single tool from start to finish.\nThey provide better customer experience, by ensuring that even business folks are involved in building the ELT pipeline.\n\nThere are various low-code/no-code  ELT tools out there, each with its strengths and limitations, here are some you can consider for building an ELT pipeline:\n\nAirbyte\nAirbyte is an open-source data movement platform with over 300+ open-source structured and unstructured data sources. Airbyte is made up of two components; platform and connectors. The platform provides all the services required to configure and run data movement operations while the connectors are the modules that pull data from sources or push data to destinations. Airbyte also has a connector builder, a drag-and-drop interface and a low-code YAML format for building data source connectors.\nAirbyte has two plans, Cloud and Enterprise, but it is free to use if you can self-host the open-source version. Airbyte offers real-time and batch data synchronization, tracks the status of data sync jobs, monitors the data pipeline and views logs with a notifications system in case things go wrong. Airbyte also allows you to add custom transformations using dbt.\n\n\nFivetran\nFivetran is an automated data movement platform used for ELT. It offers automated data movement, transformations, security and governance with over 400+ no-code source connectors. You can use the function connector in Fivetran to write the cloud function to extract the data from your source, while it takes care of loading and processing the data into your destination. Fivetran gives you options to manage Fivetran connectors, to have more control over your data integration process runs. It offers a “pay-as-you-use” model, with five Free pricing plans, Starter, Standard, Enterprise and Business Critical.\n\n\nIntegrate.io\nFormerly known as Xplenty, this is another low-code platform for data movement, unlike the others it doesn’t have many connections, it offers both low-code ETL, Reverse ETL and an ELT platform. Pricing on Integrate.io is based on data volume and increases as the number of rows in your data increases. It offers both Starter, Professional and Enterprise plans, with an extra charge for additional connectors.\n\n\nStitch\nStitch is also another data movement platform owned by Qlik.

    "section": "Key Features of low-code/no-code ELT Tools",
    "text": "Key Features of low-code/no-code ELT Tools\n\nAvailability of Connectors\nELT connectors are components of an ELT tool that allow the tool to connect to a data source and make it possible for extraction and loading. When trying to go for ELT tools it is important to go for the ELT tool with the highest number of connectors, that is why an organization needs to have a list of all the data sources it uses, this will let the organization know the ELT tool to choose based on organizational data sources, most importantly connectors for revenue-generating applications. Let’s say your organization uses Zoho as a CRM. It’s important to compare various ELT tools with a connector for Zoho and see which offers the best service at the most affordable price.\n\n\nDrag-and-Drop Interfaces\nLow-code/no-code ELT tools offer an intuitive user interface with a drag-and-drop functionality, allowing non-technical users to perform ELT by dragging and dropping components without encountering any challenges. This makes the user experience seamless and users can focus on the application’s business logic. This reduces the workload on the IT team, allowing the organization’s domain experts to partake in the development process.\n\n\nAutomated Scheduling\nDue to their ability to schedule extracting and loading, automating the ELT process is very simple. This can involve creating tasks that can be run using a specified SQL schema at specific intervals. One can easily automate documentation, document process automation, and show the manipulations occurring to data from source to data storage, enabling organizations to save time and costs.\n\n\nData Transformation Capabilities\nLow-code/no-code ELT tools manage dependencies when transforming data, this is essential when you have multiple transforms depending on each other. They support the DAG(directed acyclic graph) workflow to manage the transformation dependencies after conducting a transform job using SQL on the data, reading the transformation query and calculating a dependency workflow.\n Another important aspect is their support for incremental loading, where only the differences in data are loaded from source to destination. For example Let’s consider the case of a retail store that tracks its sales data, without an incremental approach the daily sales report would involve extracting sales data from the sales table, which contains millions of records, aggregating the data to calculate the total sales, revenue and units sold for each product, store and day, and load the aggregated data into a new table called sales_daily.\nThis is a resource-intensive approach as the system needs to process all the sales data every time the report is generated. Using an incremental approach, whenever a new sale is recorded in the sales table, a trigger or a background process is used to update the sales_daily table with new data for that day and store.  Whenever every report is generated, only the data for the latest day is extracted from the sales_daily table, which is a much smaller dataset than the entire sales table. The incremental approach helps in improving performance, cost and scalability.\n\n\nMonitoring and Alerting\nMonitoring and Alerting is another important feature of a low-code/no-code ELT tool because It allows you to detect anomalies, bottlenecks and failures in the workflow, provide continuous surveillance and monitor resource utilization. Key important metrics it monitors are; latency, throughput, error rates, resource utilization and pipeline lag. They also give threshold alerts, detect anomalies, and escalate alerts to SMS or phone calls.\nImagine a manufacturing company that collects sensor data from various manufacturing plants across facilities. If analysis, reveals one machine is giving higher vibration levels than others. The ELT tool anomaly detection algorithm should trigger an alert which will prompt the maintenance team to investigate. They might identify a worn-out bearing component and schedule proactive maintenance, preventing equipment failure and uninterrupted production."

    "text": "Evaluating low-code/no-code ELT Tools\nThere are various things to consider when choosing a low-code/no-code  ELT tool.\n\nConnectors: When selecting an ELT tool, ensure it supports connections to various data sources and know how many SAAS integrations are available and how effectively the tool can connect to organizational data sources.\nRoadmap: Another important factor, is if the ELT tool can handle the company’s rapidly growing data. Is it responsive and scalable? This will give the organization an idea of the ELT tool’s sustainability in the long run.\nPricing: How does the ELT tool charge? Is it by data flows or data volume and are the features it offers worth its pricing? Some ELT tools offer more connectors at affordable pricing than others.\nSupport: Look for an ELT tool with available customer support, this is very crucial especially when things break. The ELT tools should also offer good documentation that is easy to understand by technical and non-technical users. An online community around the tool is also a plus, users can relate with fellow users and serve as support for each other.\nSecurity: How does the ELT tool prioritise security? Are organizational data safe and is it regulatory compliant with GDPR, SOC2, HIPPA, and other relevant regulations? These are important security questions to look for when selecting an ELT tool. It is also important that the organization knows, how the tool handles privacy and authentication.\nEase of use: A low-code/no-code ELT tool that is user-friendly and easy to customize is another priority to look out for, it makes the process of creating ELT pipelines easy and non-technical for business folks.\nMaintenance: When choosing a low-code/no-code ELT tool, it’s important to know how easy it is to fix problematic data sources, and if it gives informative logs if an execution fails. It is also important to know what skills are required, by team members to keep the ELT process running smoothly."

    "text": "Implementing Low-code/No-code ELT Tools\n\nPlanning the ELT Pipeline\nBefore building an ELT pipeline, you need to get the data from your source using an ELT tool like Airbyte and decide the data warehouse to use, either Google BigQuery, AWS Redshift or Snowflake. Next is to transform the data using dbt, R, Python or a no-code transformation layer such as Boltic, then consider the BI tool for presenting the data to end users.\n\n\nConfiguring Data Source and Destination Connections\nLet’s say for example using a REST API as a data source, Airbyte as the ELT tool and Amazon S3 bucks as the data destination. Create a new S3 bucket in the AWS console, in the bucket, create a folder to store data from the ELT operation in Airbyte. Create another folder in the previous folder to store the data you will extract from the REST API.\nNext, you will configure both the source and the destination connector, and connect the source and the destination. Ensure any API you use, there is a connector for it on Airbyte. If you don’t see a connector for your data source, use Airbyte’s CDK(Connector Development Kit) to create a custom connector.\nNext, you go to AWS S3 to configure the destination connector to connect Airbyte with the destination data lake, after successfully configuring both the source and the destination connector, and passing all the tests. You can now configure the ELT connection between source and destination.\n\n\n\nDesigning Data Transformation Workflows\nBefore transforming your data, you need to explore and understand it, this involves looking at your entity relationship diagrams to see how the data relate with each other, identifying missing values or misleading column names and performing a summary analysis of the data.\nWhile exploring, you might understand what is wrong with your data, and decide to perform your transformation process such as correcting misleading columns, renaming fields appropriately, adding business logic or joining data. The transformation you apply depends on what you have explored in the data. You can use tools like dbt, SQL, Python or R to transform your data or go no-code with tools like Boltic. At this stage,  test your data to meet business standards.\nFinally, you document your transformation process explaining the data model, key fields and metrics making the documentation easy for non-technical users to understand.\n\n\nScheduling and Automating ELT Processes\nBefore releasing the data to end users, you need to push it into a production environment in the data warehouse, these product-ready tables are what the BI analysis will query. With time you will need to update and refresh the data to meet the business needs, using a scheduler or orchestrator.  Using the job scheduler, you can use tools like dbt Cloud or Shipyard to create data transformations and tests within a collaborative IDE.\n\n\nMonitoring and Maintaining the ELT Pipeline\nMonitoring is important to identify bugs in data pipelines, optimise pipelines and gain valuable insights. These ELT tools provide visualisations, logging and observability systems to analyse latency, error rates and data throughput in your ELT pipeline. Most low-code/no-code provide all these out of the box, you will receive custom notifications when data problems occur allowing you to improve the quality of your data sets."

    "text": "Best Practices for low-code/no-code ELT\n\nEnsuring Data Quality and Integrity\n\nData quality and requirements: The first step before conducting an ELT is to specify the data quality and requirements. These should specify the data accuracy, completeness, consistency, timeliness, validity, and uniqueness. This also includes details of the sources, end users and data quality metrics. This will help to understand the quality of data to expect and how to achieve it.\nValidation: The next step is to validate the data quality using the ELT tools before loading them into the warehouse, to reduce the amount of bad-quality data that gets into the data warehouse.\nData quality checks: In this step, ensure you use the ELT tools to implement quality checks on the data in the data warehouse before making it available to end users so that the data is consistent, complete and correct(3Cs).\nData quality monitoring and auditing: The next step is to monitor and audit the data quality as new data gets updated into the system, this is to resolve issues of data quality when they arise. ELT tools have various tools to get reports, alerts and logs on data quality. This ensures the successful maintenance of the data in the long run.\nData quality documentation and communication: Next is to give a report explaining to the end users or stakeholders the quality of the data, this report should contain the processes, rules, metrics and issues with the data. Doing this ensures trust and transparency of the data quality.\nReview and update the data quality: Constantly use the information from the ELT tool logging system to update the data quality, from time to time. By doing this, you are ensuring that the data remains relevant and meets the organization’s requirements.\n\n\n\nHandling Data Governance and Compliance\nIt is important to define clear roles and objectives for various stakeholders and use data governance tools to automate the tasks of data validation, cleansing, standardization, profiling, auditing, and reporting. Provide a data catalogue of the data assets and other data quality indicators and recommend a staging area for the source data before moving to the data warehouse. Finally, using a schema-on-read approach allows users to apply different views to the same data, based on their needs.\n\n\nIntegrating low-code/no-code ELT with Existing Systems\nDue to the visually driven approach of low-code/no-code ELT tools, you must thoroughly assess your existing data sources, formats and structures to identify potential compatibility issues and develop appropriate mapping strategies. Check, if a connector for your data source exists before building a custom connector.\n\n\nScaling and Optimizing ELT Workflows\nOne of the reasons for scaling and optimizing an ELT process is to reduce data loss and ELT run downtime. The following are ways to optimize an ELT workflow effectively:\n\nParallelize Data Flow: Simultaneous data flow saves more time than sequential data flow, you can load a group of unrelated tables from your data source to the data warehouse, by grouping the tables into a batch and running each batch simultaneously, instead of loading the tables one by one.\nApplying data quality checks: You should ensure each data table is tested with predefined checks such as schema-based to ensure that when a test fails, the data is rejected and when it passes, it produces an output.\nCreate Generic Pipelines: Generic pipelines ensure team members reuse a code without developing one from scratch. Practices like parameterizing the values can ease the job, when one wants to use a code/pipeline, they change the values of the parameters such as database connections.\nUse of streaming instead of batching: Streaming data from the source to the data destination is the best approach, this ensures the system is up to date whenever new data is added to allow end users access to recent data."

    "text": "Future of low-code/no-code ELT\nLow-code/no-code ELT tools have become popular, offering cloud-based options and reduced infrastructure costs. Most of them now have pre-built connectors covering most data sources and automated scheduling. Advanced low-code/no-code ELT tools now have data mapping and transformation capabilities using machine learning to detect data patterns and transformation. Some low-code/no-code tools now integrate data governance features such as profiling, data lineage tracking and automated data validation rules to ensure data integrity. These innovations aim to simplify data integration and empower non-technical users.\nEven with the innovation and simplicity low-code/no-code ELT tool offers, it has some of its limitations:\n\nLow-code/no-code ELT make it difficult to collaborate as a team, unlike a code-heavy pipeline with version control and collaborative features.\nSome low-code/no-code ELT tools give poor developer experience which can hamper productivity, such as bad and non-intuitive UI design and limited customization options.\nAnother challenge with low-code/no-code ELT is the security of the applications built on them, even though the platform is secure. This is an issue since the tool was developed for non-technical individuals with no expertise in security best practices.\nThey do not offer the source code to pipelines built and this is a challenge when an organization wants to migrate to another platform, they are forced to develop from scratch on another platform or stick with that same platform."

Data engineering is not just about building pipelines but also solving business problems such as designing schemas. It’s important that the data you give to your end users can answer their questions. In summary, developing your soft skills is more important to make you stand out.\nLow-code/no-code have a lot of abstraction which when things go wrong it’s difficult to find out, some organizations will not want to give out the control they have over their data pipeline by hiding away some of the pipeline core functionality using a low-code/no-code ELT tool."

    "section": "Types of Missing Data",
    "text": "Types of Missing Data\nA missing value refers to the absence of data in a dataset. It occurs when no observation is recorded for a particular variable. Missing values can arise for reasons such as survey errors, system failures, respondents skipping survey questions, and so on. There are various types of missing values;\n\nMissing Completely at Random (MCAR)\nMissing at Random (MAR)\nMissing Not at Random (MNAR)\n\n\nMissing Completely at Random (MCAR)\nMCAR refers to a scenario where the missing observations in a dataset are independent of the observed and unobserved data. This implies that the missingness is purely random and does not depend on any systematic factor related to the dataset.\nAn example is a survey in which a respondent skips a question due to a software glitch or a lab experiment in which test results are missing due to random equipment failure.\nMCAR can occur due to technical data collection issues, survey non-response unrelated to systematic reasons, or randomly lost or corrupted data without any pattern. MCAR does not introduce bias into a statistical analysis because it is a random occurrence.\nInferences still remain valid when data is MCAR, but the sample size is greatly reduced, which can lead to wider confidence intervals and lower power in hypothesis tests. Statistical tests like Little’s MCAR tests can help verify whether data is MCAR or not.\nSince MCAR does not introduce bias, you can use several methods to handle the missing values:\n\nListwise Deletion: Remove cases with missing values since the missing values are random.\nPairwise Deletion: Use the available data in calculations without deleting any observation.\nMean/Median/Mode Imputation: Replace missing values with the mean/median for numerical variables or mode for categorical variables.\nMultiple Imputation: Use statistical methods to estimate and replace missing values while accounting for uncertainty.\nMaximum Likelihood Estimation: A more advanced approach that estimates parameters directly using the likelihood function.\n\n\n\nMissing at Random (MAR)\nMAR is a situation in which the missing values are dependent on observed variables; that is, the probability of missingness depends on the observed data but not on the missing data itself.\nFor example, older patients might miss blood pressure readings more frequently. If age is recorded, the missingness depends on an observed variable (age) but not on the blood pressure values.\nIn MAR, the missing data is conditional on observed data, indicating it is random. This makes it easier for better statistical handling compared to Missing Not at Random (MNAR), which we will see in the next section.\nMAR can result from respondents skipping sensitive questions or non-response patterns influenced by observed data by education, age, or location.\nBecause one can predict MAR values based on observed data, you can use the following statistical methods to handle them:\n\nMultiple Imputation: Predicts missing values based on observed data.\nMaximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE): Estimate parameters without imputing missing values, just like it is common in regression and Structural Equation Modelling (SEM)\nWeighting Methods: Adjusts for missing data by assigning weights to observed data; this is often used in survey analysis.\n\n\n\nMissing Not at Random (MNAR)\nMNAR occurs when the probability of missing data depends on unobserved data. This indicates that the missing data is systematically related and not random.\nA typical example in a medical study is if patients with severe symptoms are more likely to drop out of a clinical trial and their severity is not recorded. This is a scenario of MNAR.\nConducting analysis on data with MNAR can lead to biased estimates since the missing values are not dependent on any of the observed values. MNAR also reduces the dataset’s representativeness since a significant portion is missing.\nUnlike MCAR and MAR, which one can handle using traditional imputation methods, such as mean or regression-based imputation, MNAR needs an advanced approach such as:\n\nModeling the Missing Data Mechanism: You can use external information to develop a model and estimate the missing values based on known relationships. This external information will convert the data from MNAR to MAR, where you can now use any of their respective handling methods to fill in the missing values.\nSensitivity Analysis: Conducting sensitivity analysis helps assess the impact of different assumptions about missing data.\nMultiple Imputation with MNAR Models: Using imputation techniques that account for MNAR patterns, such as Heckman selection or pattern-mixture models.\nUsing Domain Knowledge: Subject-matter expertise can guide adjustments and improve estimation techniques."

    "text": "Identifying the Type of Missing Data\nIt’s important to know the type of missingness in a dataset to help you choose the right imputation technique. You can either use statistical tests or visualization to determine the nature of the missing data. In most cases, you can even combine the two methods to achieve better results.\n\nStatistical Tests to Determine Missing Data Mechanism\n\nLittles’s MCAR Test: This chi-square test checks if missingness is dependent on both observed and unobserved values. If the test fails, the null hypothesis is rejected, signifying that the data is MCAR. Otherwise, the missingness is either MAR or MNAR.\nt-Tests or ANOVA for MAR vs MCAR: Comparing observed values between missing and non-missing groups can help determine if missingness depends on available data.\nLogistic Regression of Missingness Indicators: You can use a ****binary missingness indicator (1 = missing, 0 = observed) to regress on observed variables. If the missingness is significantly related to observed data, it suggests MAR. If no relationships are found, it suggests MCAR.\n\n\n\nVisualizing Missing Data Patterns\n\nMissingness Matrix (Heatmap): You can use a statistical software to create a heatmap to display where values are missing in a dataset.\nBar Charts of Missing Values: Plotting the missing values per variable to show which variables are most affected.\nPairwise Missingness Scatterplots: Visualizing whether missing values in one variable correlate with missing values in another.\nPattern Plots (Upset Plots or Venn Diagrams): These show combinations of missing values in different variables and can help detect dependencies."

Their presence can skew statistical measures like the mean and standard deviation, affect model accuracy, lead to biased parameter estimates, or indicate important events such as fraud detection.\nThere are various types of outliers:\n\nGlobal Outliers (Point Anomalies): These data points significantly deviate from the rest of the dataset. For example, a person with a height of 2.5 meters in a general population dataset.\nContextual Outliers (Conditional Anomalies): These data points are called outliers in a specific context. An example is a temperature of 20°C, which is normal in spring but abnormal in winter.\nCollective Outiers: These are a group of data points that collectively deviate from expected patterns, though individual points may not appear unusual. For example, if many requests suddenly come from the same IP address in a short time frame, it could indicate a bot attack.\n\nOutlier detection is necessary as it can provide more insights depending on the data type you are working with, such as fraud detection, medical diagnosis, network security, etc.\nIt’s also important to clean and process the data before applying statistical or machine learning models, as most models are sensitive to outliers.

    "text": "Z-Score Method\nThe Z-score, also known as the standard score, measures how deviated a value is from the mean(\\(\\mu\\)) of a dataset. It compares individual data points to the overall distribution and determines how unusual a value is within a dataset.\nOn the other hand, the standard deviation(\\(\\sigma\\)) is a measure of the dispersion or spread of a set of values. The formula for the Z-score is given as\n\\[\nZ = \\frac{X-\\mu}{\\sigma}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\nZ is the Z-score\nX is the individual data point\n\\(\\mu\\) is the mean of the dataset\n\\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of the dataset.\n\nHere are the possible ways to interpret the Z-score:\n\nIf a point has a Z-score of 0, the data point is exactly at the mean.\nIf the Z-score is positive, the value is above the mean. For example, a Z-score of 2 means the data point is 2 standard deviations above the mean\nIf the Z-score is negative, the value is below the mean. For example, a Z-score of -1.5 means the data point is 1.5 standard deviations below the mean.\n\nThe Z-score works best when the sample size is large and is sensitive to unusual high or low values. It is mostly used in testing statistical hypotheses, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.\nIt also standardizes a variable, allowing for comparison regarding its measurement. For example, using their Z-score, you can compare two weight variables measured in pounds and kilograms.\nThe table below gives the pros and cons of the Z-score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPros\nCons\n\n\n\n\nEasy to compare values from different datasets.\n\n\n\nHelps detects anomalies in the data.\nExtreme value can distort mean and standard deviation, which are needed to calculate the Z-score.\n\n\nMost effective with normally distributed data.\nNot useful for skewed or non-normal distributions, because it assumes normality.\n\n\nUseful for probability calculations.\nStatistical knowledge needed for interpretation."

Sigma AI Browser\nAlthough Sigma AI functions as a browser, it is far more than a traditional web tool, it is an AI-powered, agentic browser designed to both gather and analyze data.\nUnlike other analytics platforms, Sigma AI can actively scrape information from websites, allowing it to serve as both a data source and a data analysis tool. This makes it particularly useful for users who need to collect real-time information from the web before running their analysis.\nSigma AI also supports connecting to various cloud storage solutions, enabling users to import and clean their existing datasets, conduct analysis, and generate comprehensive reports, all within the same environment. This end-to-end workflow provides a streamlined experience for handling small to medium-sized data projects without switching between multiple tools.\nHowever, its limitations become clear when dealing with large-scale data. Sigma AI does not support connections to major big-data platforms or data warehouses, which restricts its use to smaller datasets and lightweight analytic tasks. Despite this, it remains a powerful option for quick analysis, web scraping needs, and compact reporting workflows.\n\n\n\n9. Fellou.ai\nFellou is another powerful agentic browser designed to help users automate data collection and analysis at scale. It can scrape and aggregate information from a wide range of online sources, including product reviews, blog posts, news sites, forums, and social media platforms.\nOnce the data is gathered, Fellou allows you to organize, visualize, and interpret it by creating interactive dashboards, summaries, and reports, eliminating much of the manual effort traditionally required in research and analytics.\nOne of Fellou’s standout features is its proprietary framework, Eko, which enables users to build custom AI agents tailored to specific data analysis workflows or use cases. You can train these agents to follow predefined routines such as monitoring trends, comparing competitors, tracking customer sentiment, or generating periodic insights. This makes Fellou particularly useful for product managers, marketers, researchers, founders, and data analysts who need recurring or specialized data intelligence.\nOn its free plan, users can run up to four tasks and set up two scheduled (automated) tasks, which is sufficient for light experimentation or small, targeted projects. Even with this limitation, Fellou remains highly effective for prototype-level research or one-off analysis.\nWhat truly makes Fellou powerful is its prompt-driven workflow. You can simply describe what you want in natural language, and Fellou will automatically determine the data sources, gather the relevant information, analyze it, and present the findings in a structured report.\nFor instance, you could prompt Fellou to “analyze LinkedIn job descriptions for AI Product Manager roles, focusing on required skills, years of experience, tools, and hiring trends.” Based on that instruction, it will search for relevant job postings, extract and categorize key information, and return a detailed summary of current industry demand, emerging skills, and noticeable patterns in hiring.\nThis level of automation turns Fellou into more than just a browser, it acts as an intelligent research assistant capable of performing complex data analysis tasks that would otherwise take hours or days to complete manually.\n\n\n\n10. Data Formulator\nData Formulator, developed by Microsoft Research, is an AI-powered tool focused primarily on exploratory data analysis and data visualization. It is designed to help users transform raw data into meaningful, visually compelling charts with minimal manual configuration. Users can connect Data Formulator to both databases and cloud storage folders, making it easy to work with structured data from a wide variety of sources.\nOne of its most innovative features is its prompt-based interaction model. Instead of manually configuring fields, axes, and filters as in traditional BI tools, you can simply describe the type of visualization you want in natural language. For example, you might prompt: “Show a line chart of monthly revenue growth for the past two years, broken down by region.” The tool then intelligently determines which variables to use, how they should be mapped, and what type of chart best represents your request.\nAlternatively, users can start with a set of pre-built visual templates. From there, the app automatically suggests the most appropriate variables and relationships in the dataset, making it more approachable even for users who don’t have advanced data visualization experience.\nAt the moment, the online version of Data Formulator is limited in functionality, and running it locally may require some technical knowledge, including familiarity with development environments and configuration steps. Despite these early limitations, it is an incredibly promising and capable tool for data exploration and rapid insight generation.\nAnother major advantage is its flexibility with AI models. Users can bring their own existing AI API key (such as an OpenAI-compatible key) and integrate it directly into the application, making it easier to control model usage, scale, and costs.\nOverall, Data Formulator stands out as a highly effective and forward-thinking solution for analysts, researchers, and data-driven teams who want to speed up both the discovery and visual storytelling phases of data analysis."
